<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br />

<p>It must surely be clear to-day to many of those who opposed the Home
Rule Bill of 1893 that there is a problem of which the solution is now
more urgent than ever. We who were Gladstonian Home Rulers approached
the problem originally from the Irish side: those who did not then
approach it from that side refused to admit the existence of any
problem at all. Since that time circumstances have made it necessary
to approach the problem from the British as well as from the Irish
side.</p>

<p>The British Parliament has hitherto been regarded as a model to be
imitated; if it continues to attempt the impossible task of
transacting in detail both local and Imperial business, it will end as
an example to be avoided. In the last fifty years the amount of work
demanded for particular portions of the United Kingdom, for the United
Kingdom as a whole, or for the Empire has increased enormously; in all
three categories the work is still increasing and will increase: one
Parliament cannot do it all. This is one new aspect of the Home Rule
question.</p>

<p>Mr. Spender states the case with force and sympathy from the Irish
point of view, with which none of us, who were convinced supporters of
Home Rule twenty years ago can ever lose sympathy, and with which the
younger generation should make itself acquainted. He makes also <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>a
very valuable and opportune review of recent changes in the situation,
and considers how Home Rule should be adapted to British and Imperial
needs, and should serve them. The whole book is the result of his own
reflection, observation and research; the conclusions to which he
comes for the settlement of the financial and other details of Home
Rule ought to receive most careful consideration as valuable
contributions to the discussion of the subject. But, of course, they
must not be assumed necessarily to be mine or to be those that will be
adopted in the Government Bill.</p>

<p>But I agree with him entirely that Home Rule is necessary to heal
bitterness in Ireland, and to effect that reconciliation without which
there cannot be real union: that it is necessary to relieve Parliament
at Westminster and to set it free for work that concerns the United
Kingdom as a whole or the Empire: in other words, that there is a
problem to be solved, and that the first step in solving it must be
Irish Home Rule in a form that opens the way for Federal Home Rule.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1910 a considerable part, at any rate, of the
Conservative Party seemed ready to admit the need for some solution:
to-day they have apparently drifted back to the barren position of
opposing all proposals for Home Rule: if they were to render this
solution impossible, they would but make the problem more urgent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h3>THE HOME RULE CASE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Very nearly a generation of time has elapsed since, in 1886, Mr.
Gladstone expounded in the British House of Commons his first Bill for
restoring to Ireland a Home Rule Parliament. Nearly twenty years have
passed since that same great man, indomitably defying age and
infirmities in the pursuit of his great ideal, passed the second Home
Rule Bill (1893) through the British House of Commons. That Bill
stands to-day unshaken in regard to all its vital clauses. Some of us
still hold the faith that that Bill would, if it had become law in
1893, have saved Ireland from many years of wastage, and would have
built up, to face our enemies in the gate, a stronger and stouter
fabric of Empire.</p>

<p>The Bill of 1893 only survived the perilous tempests of the House of
Commons<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to fall a victim to the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Nearly twenty years have elapsed since that day, and now the
successors of Mr. Gladstone, the Progressives of the United Kingdom,
Liberals, Labour Members and Nationalists, approach the same task with
the Bill of 1912.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Some of them are veterans of the former strife.
They can turn, like the present writer, to the thumbed diaries of that
great combat,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and can recall the great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>scenes of that prolonged
Parliamentary agony with a sense of treading again some well-worn
road. Others are new to the issue, and can only hear, like "horns of
Elf-land faintly blowing," some faint echo from the dawn of
consciousness.</p>

<p>But young or old, we must again set forth on our travels, and this
time&mdash;</p>

<p>"It may be that we shall touch the Happy Isles."</p>

<p>It will be the memory of the "Great Achilles" that will sustain us.
For this task comes to Liberals as a sacred trust from Mr. Gladstone.
It is from him that they have learnt that race-hatred is poison, and
that the only true union between nations is&mdash;in a phrase that has
outlived the silly laughter of the shallow&mdash;the "Union of Hearts."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
It is Mr. Gladstone's work that they design to accomplish. It is the
memory of his passionate and sustained devotion through the last
twenty years of that glorious life that has thrown a halo round this
cause, and still gilds it with a "heavenly alchemy."</p>

<p>But, before we "smite the sounding furrows," our first duty is to
survey once more the seas over which we shall have to voyage. We have
to consider again both the old and the new "case for Home Rule"&mdash;not
merely the case of 1886 or 1893, but the still stronger case of 1912.</p>

<p>For the world never stands still, and in every generation every great
human problem presents different aspects, and shows new lights and
shadows. Every great human question is like a great mountain which on
a second or third visit reveals new and unsuspected depths and
heights, new valleys and new peaks, slopes which new avalanches have
furrowed, and glaciers which have receded or advanced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Not that the real, great, main outline ever changes. As with the
mountains, so with the great human problems; there are always certain
great features which remain permanent.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE SEA</h4>

<p>There are, for instance, in the Irish case the sixty-five miles of sea
which, since the earliest dawn of human memory, have divided Ireland
from Great Britain. A fact absurdly simple and obvious, but the
greatest feature of all in this mighty problem of human government!</p>

<p>"The sea forbids Union, and the Channel forbids Separation." There is
no change in that great physical condition. Those sixty-five miles of
sea have neither increased nor diminished since 1893. That sea is
still too broad for "Union"&mdash;in the Parliamentary sense of that
word&mdash;and too narrow for Separation.</p>

<p>To anyone standing on the deck of one of those swift steamships which
now cross to Ireland from so many points on the British coast, there
must, if he has any imagination, come some vision of the vast
impediment which this sea has placed in the way of direct control by
England over Ireland's domestic affairs. Looking back down the vista
of history, he must see a succession of fleets delayed by contrary
winds, of sea-sick kings and storm-battered convoys, of conquest
thwarted by the caprice of ocean, of peace messengers and high
administrators brought to anchor in the midst of their proud schemes.</p>

<p>The same causes still operate. In this respect, indeed, Ireland
appears to be simply one instance of a general law. It may almost be
laid down as an axiom that no nation can govern another across the
sea. How often it has been tried, and how often it has failed! France
has <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>tried it with England, and England has tried it with France.
Great Britain tried it with North America, and Spain tried it with
South. In this matter even the great quickening of modern
communications, even the miracles of steam and electricity, seem to
have made little difference. For even at the present moment, if we
look around, we shall see how great a part the sea has played as the
deciding factor in forms of government. It is the sea which has made
us give self-government to Canada, Australia, and South Africa. It is
the sea which keeps Newfoundland apart from the Canadian Federation,
and New Zealand apart from Australia. Even within the scope of these
islands the same law prevails. It is the sea which makes us give
self-government to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Almost the
only exception is Ireland. In Ireland we have defied this great law;
and in Ireland that defiance is a failure.</p>

<p>And yet not defied it completely; for the very facts of Nature
forbade. While we have taken away the Irish Legislature, we have been
obliged to leave the Irish their separate laws, their separate
Administration and Estimates, and their separate Executive in Dublin.
That Executive has been for a whole century practically uncontrolled
by any effective Parliamentary check. The result is that it has grown,
like some plant in the dark, into such quaint and eccentric shapes and
forms as to defy the control of any Minister or any public opinion<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.
Perhaps the worst condemnation of the Act of Union has <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>been that
while we destroyed the Irish Parliament we have been obliged to leave
Dublin Castle.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE RACE</h4>

<p>Then there is the permanent, abiding difference of Race. It is a
truism of history that the Englishman who settles in Ireland becomes
more Irish than the Irish. The records of the past are filled with
great examples. The Norman adventurers who spread into Ireland after
the Conquest have become in modern times the chiefs of great Irish
communities, until names like Joyce and Burke have come to be regarded
as typical Hibernian surnames. It is a commonplace of modern history
that the counties settled by Cromwellian soldiers have become most
typically Irish. Tipperary, Waterford, and Wexford&mdash;there were great
Cromwellian settlements in those counties. And yet they have taken the
lead in the fiercest insurrections of modern Irish democracy.</p>

<p>It is only in the North of Ireland, within the confines of the
province of Ulster, and there only in the extreme north-east corner,
within the counties of Londonderry, Antrim, and Down, that the
settlers have formed a distinct and definite racial breakwater against
purely Irish influences. The plantation of Ulster in the reign of
James I. took into Ireland some of the most dogged members of the
Scotch race, men filled with the new fire of the Reformation, men
stalwart for their race and creed. They went as conquerors and as
confiscators, and for centuries they worked with arms in their hands.
They slew and were slain, and were divided from the native Irish by an
overflowing river of blood. That river is not yet bridged.</p>

<p>It has been said that there is no human hatred so great as that felt
towards men whom one has wronged. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>planters of Ulster inflicted
upon Ireland many grievous wrongs and endured some fierce revenges.
The result is that even to-day there is a section of them that still
stands apart from the other colonisers of Ireland&mdash;a race still
distinct and apart. Is it impossible that even there the binding and
unifying principle of Irish life may begin to work? That is the
question of the future.</p>

<p>But though Ireland thus contains at least one instance of a mixture of
races not altogether dissimilar from that of England, it still remains
true that, taken as a whole, Ireland is a country marked with the
Celtic stamp. There, too, the power of the sea comes in. If there had
been only a land frontier, it is possible that the Teutonic influence
would have overpowered the Celtic. But the sea forms a sufficient
barrier to cut off every new band of immigrants from the country of
their origin. This isolation drives them into insular communion with
the country of their invasion. Thus, however often invaded and
"planted," Ireland has continued detached.</p>

<p>This detachment has been apparent ever since the earliest dawn of
Western civilisation. Right up to the Norman Conquest Ireland remained
apart and aloof from Central European influences. For long ages she
had been the rallying-place of the Celt as he was driven westward by
the Teuton and the Roman. Even after Great Britain had been absorbed
by the Roman Empire, Ireland still remained unconquered, the one home
of freedom in Western Europe. This independence of Rome continued far
into the Christian era. Ireland developed a separate Christianity of a
peculiarly elevated and noble type, full of missionary zeal and
inspired by high culture. That Christianity even swept eastward, and
for a time dominated Scotland and England from its homes in Iona <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>and
Lindisfarne. This Irish Christianity brought upon itself the enmity of
Rome by continuing the Eastern tonsure and the Eastern ritual, and
finally, at the great Synod at Whitby in the year 664<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, Rome
conquered in the struggle for Britain, and the Irish religion was
driven back across the sea.</p>

<p>But Rome and European Christianity, as it was represented in the Roman
spirit, achieved a very slow victory over Ireland herself. The English
Pope Adrian gave to Henry II. a full permission to conquer Ireland for
the faith. But it was fated that Irish Catholicism should be built up
not by submission to the Catholic Kings of England, but by resistance
to the Protestant Kings from Henry VIII. onward. Thus it is that, even
in religion, in spite of the passionate loyalty of the modern Irishman
to the Roman See, Ireland still stands somewhat distinct and aloof
from the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>But if that be so in religion, still more is it so in customs and
manners. Take the analogy of a mould. The Celtic civilisation of
Ireland is like a mould, into which fresh metal has been always
pouring; white-hot, glowing metal from all over the world, from
England and Scotland, from France, from Rome, and even from far-off
Spain. But though the metal has always been changing, the mould still
remains unbroken, and as the metal has emerged in its fixed form it
has always taken the Celtic shape. So that to-day, in face of the
Imperialistic tendencies of the British Empire, Ireland remains more
than ever passionately attached to her nationalism, and more than ever
potent to influence all newcomers with her national ideas.</p>

<p>It is in that sense that the question of race still remains <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>a
permanent feature in the Irish problem. It is precisely because the
Irish nationality is so persistent that it is hopeless to expect a
permanent settlement of her government problem within the scope of
such an iron uniformity as the Act of Union. It is because Ireland
nurses this "unconquerable hope" that the only golden key to these
difficulties lies in some form of self-government.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE CREED</h4>

<p>But besides the sea and the race, there is yet one more feature of the
Irish problem which remains practically unchanged. Ireland still
remains predominantly Catholic, while Great Britain is still
predominantly Protestant. The great movement of the sixteenth century,
known as the Reformation, passed from Germany through Holland and
France into Great Britain. It won Scotland completely. In England,
after a prolonged struggle with a powerful Catholic tradition, it
ended in the compromise still represented by the Anglican Church. But
there the victory of the Reformation closed. The movement was checked
at St. George's Channel. In Ireland Catholicism stood with its back
against the Atlantic, and fought a stern, long fight against all the
political and social forces of the British Empire. The attack of
Protestantism was supported by the full power and authority of the
conqueror. It lasted for two centuries. It began with Elizabeth and
James as a simple imperative, mercilessly applied without regard to
national conditions. It came under Cromwell as a scorching,
devastating flame. It remained under William and the Georges as a
slow, cruel torture applied through all the avenues of the law. The
end of all that effort was, not to convert or destroy, but to weld the
national and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>religious spirits into one common force, acting together
throughout the nineteenth century as if identical.</p>

<p>Purified by persecution, Catholicism in Ireland, almost alone among
the religions of Western Europe, stands out still to-day as a great
national and democratic force.</p>

<p>But though the persecution failed, it built up, by a double process of
immigration and monopoly, a very powerful Protestant population with
all the stiff pride of ascendancy. For generations the Protestants of
Ireland enjoyed all the offices of government, and had the sole right
of inheritance. Thus both the land and the government slipped into
their hands. Since no Catholic could inherit land under the penal
laws, and since the penal laws lasted for nearly a century, it
followed inevitably that the whole land of Ireland fell into the hands
of the Protestants. That is why even at the present day the vast
majority of the Irish landed and leisured classes are Protestants. The
Catholics, during that dark period, became hewers of wood and drawers
of water. Thus property in Ireland came to mean, not merely a division
of classes, but also a division of creeds. In spite of all the great
reforms, the descendants of these Protestants still retain most of the
wealth and most of the Government offices in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Their
resistance to any change is not, therefore, altogether surprising; and
we must remember amid all the various war-cries of the present
agitation that these gentlemen are fighting, not merely for the
integrity of the Empire, but also for position, income and power.</p>

<p>This state of affairs has varied very little for the last
half-century.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>The Census of 1911 contains, like most previous Irish Census returns,
a schedule asking for a statement of religious faith. That enables us
to tell with comparative accuracy the proportions between the
Catholics and Protestants in Ireland since 1861, when the schedule was
first introduced, right up to the present day.</p>

<p>The Preliminary Report shows that the variation has been very slight.
The round figures for 1911 are:&mdash;</p>

  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>There has been an all-round decrease, corresponding to the decrease of
the population. That decrease has been brought about by emigration,
and that emigration has taken place mainly from the Catholic provinces
of Munster and Connaught. It is inevitable, therefore, that the
Catholics should have diminished more than the Protestants. The result
of forty years' wastage of the Irish Catholic peasantry is that the
proportions of Catholics to Protestants are now three to one, as
against four to one in 1861. Allowing for the great fact of westward
emigration, this means that the relations between these two forms of
Christianity in Ireland are practically stationary.</p>

<p>The Protestants, too, we must not forget, are divided into two
sects&mdash;Episcopalian and Presbyterian&mdash;which in their history have been
almost divided from one another <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>as Catholicism and Protestantism, so
much so that several times in Irish history&mdash;as, for instance, in
1798&mdash;the Catholic and Presbyterian have been brought together by a
common persecution at the hands of the Episcopalian.</p>

<p>We must also bear in mind that the Protestants are mainly concentrated
in the two provinces of Ulster and Leinster. Ulster contains nearly
all the Irish Presbyterians&mdash;421,000 out of 439,000&mdash;men who are
rather Scotch by descent than actually native Irish. Ulster also
contains 366,000 Episcopalians, making, with 48,000 Methodists,
835,000 Protestants in Ulster, out of 1,075,000 in the whole of
Ireland. The rest of the Episcopalians are in Leinster&mdash;round
Dublin&mdash;where 140,000 are domiciled. Munster contains less than 60,000
Protestants in all, and Connaught contains little over 20,000.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It
is practically a Catholic province.</p>

<p>The great fact about this religious situation in Ireland, therefore,
is that you have a Catholic country with a strong Protestant minority.</p>

<p>We are asked to believe that this presents an insuperable obstacle to
the gift of self-government. But Ireland does not stand alone in this
respect. There are many other countries in the world where the same
difficulty has been faced and overcome. Take the German Empire. It has
included since 1870 the great state of Bavaria, where the great
struggle of the Reformation ended with honours divided. Modern Bavaria
contains a population which, according to the Religious Census of
December 1st, 1905, is thus divided:&mdash;</p>

</table>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Strangely enough, the proportions are almost precisely the same as in
Ireland. But this state of affairs has not prevented the German Empire
from leaving to Bavaria, not merely a king and parliament, but also an
army subject to purely Bavarian control in time of peace, and a
separate system of posts, telegraphs, and state railways.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Are we
to say that trust and tolerance are German virtues, unknown to the
British people?</p>

<p>But they are not unknown to the British people. Our own colonists have
set us a better example. Canada has a far more difficult religious
problem than Great Britain. She has two provinces side by side&mdash;Quebec
and Ontario&mdash;both with the same religious problem as Ireland. In both
there are strong religious minorities. Quebec is predominantly
Catholic, and Ontario is predominantly Protestant. Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>How is this problem solved? Why, by Home Rule. For a long time&mdash;from
1840 to 1887&mdash;Canada made the experiment of governing these two
provinces under one Parliament and from one centre. That experiment
never succeeded. As long as they were under one government, the
minority in each of these provinces insisted on appealing for help to
the majority in the other. There arose the evil of "Ascendancy "&mdash;the
government of a majority by a minority. At last the Canadians faced
the problem. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>In 1867 they divided the provinces, and gave them each a
Home Rule government of their own, subject to the Dominion Parliament.
Since then there has been no more trouble about Ascendancy. Quebec and
Ontario now settle their own affairs, including Education and all
other local matters, and no one ever hears anything about the
ill-treatment of minorities.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the permanent factors&mdash;Sea, Race, and Religion.
There is no insuperable obstacle there. Rather it is here&mdash;in these
great dominating facts&mdash;that the strongest argument for Home Rule must
ever be found. For it is those things that constitute nationality.</p>

<p>The real difficulties in the way of Home Rule were found, both in 1886
and 1893, not in these permanent things, but in the changing facets of
human laws. It was the Land Question that in all the speeches of 1886
provided the strongest argument. It was the absence of local
government, and the presumed incapacity for local government, that
filled so many Unionist speeches. It was the quarrel over University
Education that provided the best evidence of incompatibility of temper
between Irish Catholic and Irish Protestant.</p>

<p>I shall show that in all these respects the problem has completely and
radically changed since 1893.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h3>THE HOME RULE CASE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Those who, like myself, visited Ireland last summer as delegates of
the Eighty Club included some who had not thoroughly explored that
country since the early nineties. They were all agreed that a great
change had taken place in the internal condition of Ireland. They
noticed a great increase of self-confidence, of prosperity, of hope.
Many who entered upon that tour with doubts as to the power of the
Irish people to take up the burden of self-government came back
convinced that her increase in material prosperity would form a firm
and secure basis on which to build the new fabric.</p>

<p>What does this new prosperity amount to? The new Census figures leave
us in no doubt as to its existence. For the first time there is a real
check in that deplorable wastage of population that has been going on
for more than half a century. The diminution of population in Ireland
revealed by the 1901 Census amounted to 245,000 persons. The
diminution revealed by the 1911 Census amounts to 76,000. In other
words, the decrease of 1901-11 is 1.5 per cent., as against 5.2 per
cent, for 1891-1901, or only one against five in the previous
decade<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. This is far and away the smallest decrease that has taken
place in any of the decennial periods since 1841; and this decrease
is, of course, accompanied by a corresponding decline in the
emigration figures.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>What is even more refreshing is the evidence which goes to show that
the population left behind in Ireland has become more prosperous. For
the first time since 1841, the Census now shows an increase&mdash;small,
indeed, but real&mdash;of inhabited houses in Ireland, and a corresponding
increase in the number of families<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>It is the first slight rally of a country sick almost unto death. We
must not exaggerate its significance. Ireland has fallen very low, and
she is not yet out of danger. There is no real sign of rise in the
extraordinarily small yield of the Irish income tax. That yield shows
us a country, with a tenth of the population, which has only a
thirtieth of the wealth of Great Britain&mdash;a country, in a word, at
least three times as poor<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>. The diminution in the Irish pauper
returns is entirely due to Old-age Pensions.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The much-advertised
increase in savings and bank deposits, always in Ireland greatly out
of proportion to her well-being, is chiefly eloquent of the
extraordinary lack of good Irish investments.</p>

<p>The birth-rate in Ireland, although the Irish are the most prolific
race in the world, is still&mdash;owing to the emigration of the
child-bearers&mdash;the lowest in Europe. The record in lunacy is still the
worst, and the dark cloud of consumption, though slightly lifted by
the heroic efforts of Lady Aberdeen, still hangs low over
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Finally, while we rejoice that the rate of decline in the population
is checked, we must never forget that the Irish population is still
declining, while that of England, Wales and Scotland is still going
up.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>But still the sky is brightening, and ushering in a day suitable for
fair weather enterprises. Perhaps the surest and most satisfactory
sign of revival in Irish life is to be found in the steady upward
movement of the Irish Trade Returns.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> That movement has been going
on steadily since the beginning of the twentieth century.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It is
displayed quite as much in Irish agricultural produce as in Irish
manufactured goods; and in view of certain boasts it may be worth
while to place on record the fact that the agricultural export trade
of Ireland is greater by more than a third than the export of linen
and ships.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Denmark preceded Ireland in her agricultural
development, but it must be put to the credit of Irish industry and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>energy that Ireland is now steadily overhauling her rivals.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The mere recital of these facts, indeed, gives but a faint impression
of the actual dawn of social hope across the St. George's Channel. In
order to make them realise this fully, it would be necessary to take
my readers over the ground covered by the Eighty Club last summer, in
light railways or motor-cars, through the north, west, east and south
of Ireland. Everywhere there is the same revival. New labourers'
cottages dot the landscape, and the old mud cabins are crumbling
back&mdash;"dust to dust"&mdash;into nothingness. Cultivation is improving. The
new peasant proprietors are putting real work into the land which they
now own, and there is an advance even in dress and manners. Drinking
is said to be on the decline, and the natural gaiety of the Irish
people, so sadly overshadowed during the last half-century, is
beginning to return.</p>

<p>It is like the clearing of the sky after long rain and storm. The
clouds have, for the moment, rolled away towards the horizon, and the
blue is appearing. Will the clouds return, or is this improvement to
be sure and lasting? That will depend on the events of the next few
years.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>What has produced this great change in the situation since 1893? To
answer that question we must look at the Statute Book. We shall then
realise that defeat in the division lobbies was not the end of Mr.
Gladstone's policy <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>in 1886 and 1893. That policy has since borne rich
fruit. It has been largely carried into effect by the very men who
opposed and denounced it. Not even they could make the sun stand still
in the heavens.</p>

<p>The Tories and Liberal dissentients who defeated Mr. Gladstone gave us
no promise of these concessions. The only policy of the Tory Party at
that time was expressed by Lord Salisbury in the famous phrase,
"Twenty years of resolute government." Although the Liberal Unionists
were inclined to some concession on local government, Lord Salisbury
himself held the opinion that the grant of local government to Ireland
would be even more dangerous to the United Kingdom than the grant of
Home Rule.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>If we turn back, indeed, to the early Parliamentary debates and the
speeches in the country, we find that Mr. Chamberlain in 1886
concentrated his attack rather on Mr. Gladstone's Land Bill<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> than
on his Home Rule scheme. In his speech on the second reading of the
1886 Bill, indeed, Mr. Chamberlain proclaimed himself a Home Ruler on
a larger scale than Mr. Gladstone&mdash;a federal Home Ruler. But in the
country, he brought every resource of his intellect to oppose the
scheme of land purchase.</p>

<p>Similarly with John Bright. Lord Morley, in his "Life of Gladstone,"
describes Bright's speech on July 1st, 1886, as the "death warrant" of
the first Home Rule <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>Bill. But if we turn to that speech we find that
Bright, too, based his opposition to Home Rule almost entirely on his
hatred of the great land purchase scheme of that year. He called it a
"most monstrous proposal." "If it were not for a Bill like this," he
said, "to alter the Government of Ireland, to revolutionise it, no one
would dream of this extravagant and monstrous proposition in regard to
Irish land; and if the political proposition makes the economic
necessary, then the economic or land purchase proposition, in my
opinion, absolutely condemns the political proposition." In other
words, John Bright held to the view that it was the necessity for the
Irish Land Bill of 1886 which condemned the Home Rule Bill of that
year.</p>

<p>So powerfully did that argument work on the feelings of the British
public that in the Home Rule Bill of 1893, not only was the land
purchase proposition dropped, but in its place a clause was actually
inserted forbidding the new Irish Parliament to pass any legislation
"respecting the relations of landlord and tenant for the sale,
purchase or re-letting of land" for a period of three years after the
passing of the Act.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>So anxious was Mr. Gladstone to show to the English people that Home
Rule could be given to Ireland without the necessity of expenditure on
land purchase, and with comparative safety to the continuance of the
landlord system in Ireland!</p>

<p>Such was the record on these questions up to the year 1895, when the
Unionists brought the short Liberal Parliament to a close, and entered
upon a period of ten years' power, sustained in two elections with a
Parliamentary majority of 150 in 1895 and of 130 in 1900.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>But the biggest Parliamentary majorities have limits to their powers.
Crises arise. Accidents happen. There is always a shadow of coming
doom hanging over the most powerful Parliamentary Governments. With it
comes an anxiety to settle matters in their own way, before they can
be settled in a way which they dislike. Thus it is that we find that
between 1895 and 1905, during that ten years of Unionist power, two
great steps were taken towards a peaceful settlement of the Irish
question.</p>

<p>One was the Irish Local Government Act of 1898, which extended to
Ireland the system of local government already granted in 1889 to the
country districts of England. The other was the great Land Purchase
Act of 1903, which carried out Mr. Gladstone's policy of 1886, and set
on foot a gigantic scheme of land-transference from Irish landlord to
Irish tenant. That scheme is still to-day in process of completion.</p>

<p>It is these two Acts which have largely changed the face of Ireland.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>LOCAL GOVERNMENT</h4>

<p>Take first the Act of 1898. Up to that year the county government of
Ireland was carried on entirely by a system of grand jurors,
consisting chiefly of magistrates, and selected almost entirely from
the Protestant minority. These gentlemen assembled at stated times,
and settled all the local concerns of Ireland, fixing the rates,
deciding on the expenditure, and carrying out all the local Acts. They
formed, with Dublin Castle, part of the great machinery of Protestant
Ascendancy. Very few Catholics penetrated within that sacred circle.</p>

<p>These gentlemen, even now for the most part Protestants, still hold
the power of justice. But the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>power of local government has passed
from their hands. Every county of Ireland now has its County Council.
Beneath the County Councils there are also District Councils
exercising in Ireland, as in England, the powers of Boards of
Guardians. Neither the Irish counties nor the corporations of
Ireland's great cities have power over their police. There are no
Irish Parish Councils. Otherwise Ireland now possesses powers of local
government almost as complete as those of England and Scotland.</p>

<p>How has this system worked? In the discussions that preceded the
establishment of local government in Ireland we heard many prophecies
of doom. So great was the fear of trusting Ireland with any powers of
self-government that the Unionists actually proposed, in 1892, a Local
Government Bill, which would have established local bodies subject to
special powers of punishment and coercion.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It was with much fear and trembling, then, that the Protestant Party in
Ireland entered upon the new period of local government. As a matter of
fact, all these fears have been falsified. Instead of proving
inefficient and corrupt, the Irish County Councils have gained the
praises of all parties. They have received testimonials in nearly every
report of the Irish Local Government Board. If, indeed, they possess
any fault, it is that they are too thrifty and economical.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>In one respect, indeed, these County and District Councils of Ireland
have conspicuously surpassed the corresponding bodies that exist in
England.</p>

<p>One of the most important measures passed by the British Parliament
during this period of Irish revival has been the Irish Labourers' Act.
It was one of the first measures passed by the new Liberal Parliament
of 1906, and it has been since often amended and supplemented. But its
main provisions still stand. In this Act the Imperial Government
grants to the local authorities in Ireland loans at cheap rates for
the purpose of re-housing the Irish agricultural labourers. It places
the whole administration of these loans in the hands of the Irish
District Councils&mdash;a very delicate and difficult task.</p>

<p>So efficiently have the District Councils done their work that more
than half the Irish labourers have already been re-housed. It is fully
expected that within a few years the whole Irish agricultural
labouring population will have received under this Act good houses,
accompanied always with a plot of land at a small rent.</p>

<p>Compare with this the administration of the Small <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Holdings Act by the
English local authorities. That Act, passed in 1908, placed the actual
allocation of small holdings in the hands of the English County
Councils. It is not necessary to dwell here upon the notorious failure
of most of the high hopes with which that measure was passed through
the British Parliament. The cause of that failure is obvious. The
promise of the Small Holdings Act has been practically destroyed by
the refusal of the County Councils to throw either goodwill or
efficiency into its administration.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>LAND PURCHASE</h4>

<p>But the second of the two great renovating measures&mdash;the Irish Land
Purchase Act of 1903&mdash;has contributed even more powerfully than the
first to the recovery of Ireland during the last ten years. There
again we have a great instance of the supremacy of the spirit of
Parliament over the prejudices of Party. The whole tendency of
democratic government is so rootedly opposed to coercion that it is
difficult for any party to continue on purely coercive lines for any
long period. And yet, as Mr. Gladstone always pointed out with such
prescience, the only alternatives in Ireland were either coercion or
government according to Irish ideas.</p>

<p>Now, the most noted Irish idea was the desire for personal ownership
of the soil by the cultivator himself. In the years 1901 and 1902,
just when the Unionists were embarrassed with all the complications of
the South African trouble, the Tory Government were faced again with
this imperious desire. They found arising in Ireland a new revolt
against the power of the landlords. The Land Courts of Ireland, set up
under the Act of 1881, had given to the Irish tenant two revisions of
rent&mdash;the first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>in 1882, and the second in 1896&mdash;amounting in all to
nearly 40 per cent. But these sweeping reductions had produced a new
trouble. They had brought about a state of acute hostility between
landlord and tenant without any real control of the land by either.
The landlords, deprived of their powers of eviction and rent-raising,
were in a state of sullen fury. The tenants had made the fatal
discovery that their best interest lay in bad cultivation. Both
parties were opposed to the existing land administration, and the
Irish people were on the eve of another great effort to attain their
ideals.</p>

<p>The Tory Government of 1902-3, then, either had to change the whole
system, or they had to enter upon a new period of coercion with a view
of suppressing the increased passion of the tenants for the full
possession of the land. Looking down such a vista, the Irish landlords
themselves could see nothing but ruin at the end. The Irish tenants
might suffer, indeed, but they would be able to drag down their
landlords in the common ruin along with them. The prospect facing the
Irish landlord was nothing less than the entire, gradual disappearance
of all rent.</p>

<p>With such a black prospect ahead, the time was ripe for a remarkable
new movement, started by two distinguished Irishmen&mdash;Mr. William
O'Brien on the side of the tenants, and Lord Dunraven on the side of
the landlords. The omens were auspicious. Lord Cadogan, one of the old
guard, had retired from the Viceroyalty, and had been succeeded in
1902 by a younger and more open-minded man, Lord Dudley. A still more
remarkable man, Sir Anthony MacDonnell (now Lord MacDonnell) had been
appointed to the Under-Secretaryship of Dublin Castle under
circumstances which have not even yet been clearly explained. Sir
Anthony MacDonnell was known to be a Nationalist, although his
Nationalist tendencies <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>had been strongly modified by a prolonged and
distinguished career in India. Mr. Wyndham, then Chief Secretary, made
the remarkable statement that Sir Anthony MacDonnell was "invited by
me rather as a colleague than as a mere Under-Secretary to register my
will." There is, indeed, no doubt that if the full facts were known,
it would be found that the new Under-Secretary was appointed on terms
which practically implied the adoption of a new Irish policy by the
Tory Government. In other words, the party which is at the present
moment (1912) entering upon an uncompromising fight against Home Rule
was, in 1903, contemplating a policy not far removed from that very
idea.</p>

<p>In the mind of Sir Anthony MacDonnell himself&mdash;and probably of several
members of the Government&mdash;the policy took two forms. One was to
settle the problem of Irish land, and the other was to settle the
problem of Irish Government.</p>

<p>The first of these great enterprises went through with remarkable
smoothness. Both landlords and tenants were weary of the strife, and
ready for peace on terms. The leaden, merciless pressure of the great
Land Courts set up by Mr. Gladstone's Act of 1881 had gradually worn
down the dour and obstinate wills of the Irish landlords. The very men
who had denounced land purchase as the worst element in the scheme of
1886 were now enthusiastic on its behalf. The only opposition that
could have come to such a scheme was from the House of Lords, and the
opposition of the House of Lords, as we all know, did not exist in
those blessed years. Mr. Wyndham was sanguine and enthusiastic, and
both Irish tenants and Irish landlords found a common term of
agreement in mutual generosity at the expense of the taxpayer. With
the help of that taxpayer&mdash;commonly called "British," but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>including,
be it remembered, the Irish taxpayer also&mdash;the landlords were able to
go off with a generous bonus, and the tenants were able to obtain
prospective possession of their farms, while paying for a period of
years an annual instalment considerably less than their old rent.</p>

<p>The terms to both landlords and tenants were so favourable that the
Act of 1903 was, after a short period of pause, followed in Ireland by
results which transcended the expectations of Parliament. There was a
rush on one side to sell, and on the other to buy. From 1904 to 1909
the applications kept streaming in, and the Land Commissioners were
kept at high pressure arranging the sale of estates. The pace, indeed,
was so rapid that it laid too heavy a strain on the too sanguine
finance of Mr. Wyndham's Act. The double burden of the war and Irish
land proved too great. The British Treasury found that they could not
pour out money at the rate demanded by the working of the Act. In 1909
it was found necessary to pass an amending Act, which has given rise
to fierce controversy in Ireland. That Act slightly modified the
generous terms of the Act of 1903, but not before under those terms a
revolution had already been effected. Practically half the land of
Ireland had passed before 1909 from the hands of the landlords into
those of the tenants.</p>

<p>Even on the new terms the process will go on. By voluntary means if
possible, but if not, by compulsion, the land of Ireland will pass
back within twenty years into the hands of the people.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>Here, then&mdash;in land purchase and the new machinery of local
government&mdash;are the two leading facts in the great change which had
come over Ireland since 1893. What do they signify?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Why, this. In 1886 and 1893 the Unionists pointed out, not without
some heat and passion, two main difficulties in the path to Home Rule.
One was the incompetence of the Irish people for local government.
"They are by character incapable of self-rule," was the cry; and we
all remember how Mr. Gladstone humorously described this incapacity as
a "double dose of original sin."</p>

<p>That incapacity has been disproved. The Irish have been shown to be
fully as capable of self-government as the English, Scotch, and Welsh.</p>

<p>The other great difficulty was the unsolved land question. "We cannot
desert the English garrison&mdash;the Irish landlords," was the cry. "We
cannot trust the Irish people to treat them justly." But the Irish
land question is now settled. The Irish landlords are either gone or
going. The Irish tenants are becoming peasant-proprietors. All that is
required now is a national authority to stand as trustee and guardian
of the Irish peasantry in paying their debt to the British people&mdash;or,
perhaps, even if the material condition of Ireland under Home Rule
should justify that course, to take over the debt. That is the new
"felt want," and the only way to supply it is to create a responsible
Irish self-governing Parliament.</p>

<p>Thus the two principal changes in Ireland since 1893 have not
weakened, but immensely strengthened, the case for Home Rule.</p>

not been verified. On the contrary, the County and District Councils
have, with few exceptions, properly discharged the statutory duties

themselves in difficulties and have had to receive some special

rare occurrence." (Annual Report of the Irish Local Government Board

estimates of future expenditure, they found it possible to effect
considerable reductions in their rates, and there seems to be every
reason to anticipate that, with extended experience, there will be a
still further general reduction of county rates." (Annual Report of
the Irish Local Government Board for year ending March, 1902.)</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h3>THE HOME RULE CASE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>But Land Purchase and County Councils are only part of the great
change that has come over Ireland since 1893.</p>

<p>There are other great transformations. There is the redemption of the
congested districts. There is the revival of agriculture. There is the
Old Age Pensions Act. Finally, there is the reform of the
Universities.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE CONGESTED DISTRICTS BOARD</h4>

<p>Take, first, the daring policy of social renovation by which the
forlorn peasantry of the West are being saved from the grey wilderness
into which they had been thrust by the landlordism of 1830 to 1880.</p>

<p>It is the habit of the Unionist Press to claim the whole of this work
as their own. That is rather bold of a party that lifted not a finger
while these people&mdash;said by those who know them to be the best
peasantry in Europe&mdash;were driven from the rich lands of Ireland to
till the barren moorland and scratch the very rocks on the shores of
the Atlantic. The Tories do not explain why they allowed the House of
Lords for a whole half century to seal up the exile of these poor folk
by rejecting every measure proposed for their welfare. As a matter of
fact, of course, the policy of redeeming the congested districts was
not first proposed either by the Tories or by the Liberals, but by the
Irish members themselves.</p>

<p>The Tory claim is based, of course, on the fact that the first step
towards action by the British Government <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>dates from the famous
Western tour of Mr. Arthur Balfour in the early nineties. Perhaps Mr.
Balfour was tired of the monotony of five years of coercion. At any
rate, he took that journey, and it was the best act of his political
life. He travelled along that misty fringe of the Atlantic. He saw&mdash;as
we saw last summer, and I saw in 1891&mdash;the utter poverty of that
unhappy land, where human life, sustained only by the charity of
American exiles, still pays its doleful toll to far-off, indifferent
landlords. Who can tell whether some touch of remorse did not enter
into the heart of the man who up to that time had been the greatest of
Irish coercionists since Castlereagh, when he saw with his own eyes
the sorry plight of the poorest people in Europe&mdash;the people who, in
the opinion of General Gordon, were, as a result of a century of
British civilisation, more destitute and miserable than the savages of
Central Africa?</p>

<p>Mr. Balfour, at any rate, relented from his policy of more oppression.
He even entered upon the first small beginnings of a policy of
restoration.</p>

<p>It was a very small beginning&mdash;that first Congested Board&mdash;and a
Commission that reported on its work nearly twenty years after<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
decided that the Board had neither powers nor cash sufficient for its
work. The Liberal Government of 1906-10 frankly accepted the opinion
of the Commission, and gave the Board both new powers and new funds in
the Irish Land Act of 1909. Under that Act the Congested Board is
endowed with &pound;250,000 a year, and has authority over half the area and
a third of the population of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Over these <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>great
regions<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> this authority now possesses extensive powers of purchase,
rehousing, replanting, creation of fisheries, provision of seed and
stocks&mdash;powers, in short, extending to the complete restoration, by
compulsion if necessary, of a whole community. The Board is appointed
by the Chief Secretary,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and already in two short years it has
accomplished great work. Estates are being bought and replanted;
holders are being migrated from bad land to good; villages are being
rebuilt; industries encouraged; health safeguarded; fisheries revived.
Those who examine its work as we did last summer will experience the
feeling of men looking on at a splendid and gallant effort to salvage
a race submerged.</p>

<p>This work, indeed, is still in its infancy. There are many absentee
landlords who are still holding out for heavy and extravagant prices
as a reward for the poverty and misery which they have often in large
part caused by their own neglect. The Board appears to be reaching the
limits of voluntary action. Much of the hope for the future of Ireland
rests on their courage and skill.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE</h4>

<p>The passing of landlordism has produced a great revival of energy and
life in the rural districts. That revival began in the nineties, and
the credit for first realising its importance and significance must be
given to Sir Horace Plunkett. But private organisation alone could not
meet the needs of the situation. In 1899 the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Government were
persuaded by the Irish party to pass an Act founding a new Irish Board
of Agriculture on broad and generous lines.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This Irish Board of Agriculture is a very remarkable body. It is
practically a Home Rule authority for agricultural purposes only. The
Irish Minister for Agriculture by no means rules as an autocrat. He
has to submit his policy to a large "Advisory Council" of over 100
members elected by all the County Councils of Ireland. Out of this
Council a committee is chosen which is practically a Cabinet. This
Agricultural Parliament now plays a most important part in the life of
Ireland. It speaks for the whole nation more than any other public
body. Its discussions are practical and useful. It is a training
ground for the rulers of the future, and it is playing a vital part in
bringing together the best men of the North and South. The Ulster
members are already, in agricultural matters, working in a friendly
spirit side by side with the men from the South.</p>

<p>Thus advised and kept in touch with public opinion, the Board of
Agriculture is the most popular and effective Department in Dublin
Castle. It gives us a foretaste of the new power that will be given to
Irish administration by the Home Rule spirit.</p>

<p>For it is just this central guidance that the other great new Irish
developments chiefly lack. Take local government. There is not a
County Council in Ireland which would not be stronger if it were
directed&mdash;and sometimes, perhaps, even commanded&mdash;from the centre by a
sympathetic national authority. There is not a Board in Ireland,
whether it be the Congested Districts Board, or the Estates
Commissioners, or the Land Commission, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>that would not be more wisely
directed if there were some central arena in which the great
principles of administration could be seriously and responsibly
debated and settled. For, in spite of the popular notion that Irishmen
are too talkative, there is really too little discussion in Ireland on
practical affairs. The great unsolved political problem blocks the
way. The block cannot be removed except by settlement. One of the
strongest reasons for granting Home Rule is in order to free the mind
of the nation for attention to the national housekeeping.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>OLD-AGE PENSIONS</h4>

<p>One of the most remarkable events of the last few years has been the
unexpected side-share of Ireland in the great social legislation of
Great Britain. Even the Irish members themselves have scarcely
foreseen how immensely Ireland, being the poorest partner in the
United Kingdom, would benefit by a policy "tender to the poor." The
most conspicuous example of that effect has been Old-age Pensions.
Old-age Pensions have fallen on Ireland as a shower of gold. Her share
is already well over &pound;2,000,000. The great new fact in Irish social
welfare is that she now draws that great draught from the Imperial
Exchequer.</p>

<p>Travelling along the Atlantic coast last summer, I inquired in many
local post-offices as to the amount of pensions given weekly in those
little grey villages. I found that often the old-age pensioners would
number between 100 and 200 in small villages of less than 2,000
people. The emigration of the youth has left a disproportionate number
of the old, and it is not necessary to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>bring any railing accusation
against the honesty of the Irish race in order to understand why it is
that Old-age Pensions have done so much for Ireland. But the fact
remains, and it carries with it a great and unexpected relief to the
Irish ratepayer.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE NEW UNIVERSITY ACT</h4>

<p>Last, but not least, we have the great stimulus given to higher
education by the passage of Mr. Birrell's Irish University Act. For a
whole generation the progress of higher education in Ireland has been
held up by a barren and wearisome religious quarrel. Now that quarrel
has vanished, and Ireland is organising a great system of University
education for her Catholic as well as her Protestant youth. Not the
least stimulating experience of the Eighty Club in Ireland was the day
which we spent, under the guidance of the distinguished Principal, at
Cork University College, where we saw Catholics and Protestants, men
and women, young and old, working together in friendly harmony in the
splendid buildings which have sprung up to house the undergraduates of
the south-west. The same process is going on at Dublin, Galway, and
Belfast. The machinery is being rapidly prepared for training up in
the best possible atmosphere of mutual tolerance the new rulers of
Home Rule Ireland.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>Such have been the great Acts of Parliament which have created a
changed situation in Ireland. But the crown is still wanting to the
work. Those who travel in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Ireland and make any close inquiry into the
work of these Acts must feel that there is a great gap unfilled. It is
a gap at the top. All these new roads of reform are well and truly
laid&mdash;but they all lead nowhere.</p>

<p>Take one startling fact. Two Commissions of late years have considered
the great and glaring need of Ireland in the want of swift, cheap, and
convenient transport both for persons and goods. One of these
Commissions was on Canals, and the other on Railways. Both decided in
favour of national control. But as there is no national authority
which anyone trusts, both reports have been stillborn.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>It was probably some such facts that led, as far back as August, 1903,
to the uprising among the more moderate Unionist Irishmen of a
remarkable movement which is still affecting Ireland. This movement
took shape in a body; called the Irish Reform Association, presided
over, like the Land Conference, by that remarkable Irish peer Lord
Dunraven. That Conference put forward a set of proposals which are now
historical, and which have since, in varying forms, inspired the
movement for what is popularly known as "Devolution."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Mild as are the proposals of this new party, they do not differ in
principle from the proposals of the Home Rulers.</p>

<p>These proposals obtained the backing of a large section of the
Unionist Party. They undoubtedly had the sympathy of Sir Anthony
MacDonnell. It is difficult to say, at the present moment, what
precise part was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>played by Mr. George Wyndham, then still the Irish
Chief Secretary. But the eloquent fact remains that the ultimate
triumph of the Ulster Unionists over the Devolution Party of 1903 was
marked by his resignation. There would seem to be no substantial doubt
that in 1903 there arose in the Unionist Party the same division in
regard to Home Rule as arose in 1885, when Lord Carnarvon, the Tory
Viceroy, met Mr. Parnell. For the moment the better spirits seriously
contemplated removing once and for all the bitterness of the Irish
grievance. There was a return of that feeling in the autumn of 1910,
when, for the moment, at a period still known politically as the "age
of reason," most of the Unionist Press admitted how much good reason
and common-sense there was on the side of Home Rule. On each of these
occasions the same result has occurred. At the critical moment the
extreme faction of the Ulster Unionists has intervened and driven back
the Tory Party to its fatal enslavement.</p>

<p>But the great fact which produced these movements still remains as
valid and potent as ever. It is that, whatever improvements you
introduce into the Irish machine, it can never work properly until the
central motive power is a self-governing authority.</p>

<p>So deeply have the better Unionists been committed to that view in the
past, in 1885, 1903, and 1910, that they are now shaping a new
argument to face the situation of 1912. This argument is simple. It is
that the new prosperity of Ireland is not a help, but a bar to Home
Rule.</p>

<p>"If Ireland can prosper so well without Home Rule," so runs this line
of reasoning, "why give her Home Rule at all?"</p>

<p>This is indeed a strange and cruel argument. We all know the people
who used to say Home Rule was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>impossible because Ireland was
disturbed. They are now occupied in saying that she must be denied
Home Rule because she is so peaceful.</p>

<p>But now it appears that this ingenious dilemma is to be applied to her
material condition also. As with order, so with finance. In the old
days Ireland was refused Home Rule because she was too poor. How could
she get on without England? She would be bankrupt. But now that she is
better off she is to be refused it because she is too prosperous!</p>

<p>Is it not quite obvious that these are arguments after judgment? That
the people who use them are merely seeking excuses for refusing Home
Rule altogether and at all seasons?</p>

<p>The British people, essentially a just and serious people, will not
listen to these last desperate pleas, the coward fugitives of a routed
case.</p>

<p>They will rather believe that all these material improvements in the
condition of Ireland only make the need for Home Rule stronger and
more urgent. They will realise that Ireland requires not a material,
but a moral cure to give her the full value of the new reforms. Her
need is to be removed once and for all from the class of dependent
communities. She wants the great tonic cure of self-reliance and
self-responsibility.</p>

<p>For it is as true to-day as it was when Mr. Gladstone spoke these wise
and searching words in April, 1886<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"The fault of the administration of Ireland is simply this:
that its spring and source of action, and what is called its
motor muscle, is English and not Irish. Without providing a
domestic Legislature for Ireland, without having an Irish
Parliament, I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>want to know how you will bring about this
wonderful, superhuman, and, I believe, in this condition,
impossible result, that your administrative system shall be
Irish and not English?"</p></div>

<p>The greatest need is still this&mdash;to make the "motor-muscle" Irish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h3>THE HOME RULE PLAN<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>The Home Rule Bill of 1912 is now before the country, both in the
clear and simple statement of the Prime Minister and in the test of
the Bill itself<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>. The Bill has already passed through the fire of
one Parliamentary debate, and secured one great majority of 94 in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>What are the general outlines of this great measure? Its central
proposal is the creation of an Irish Parliament, responsible for the
administration of Irish affairs. That Parliament is to consist of a
Senate and a House of Commons, numbering respectively 40 and 164,
guided by an Irish Executive, chosen in the same manner as the British
Imperial Cabinet. Ireland, in other words, is to be governed by
responsible Parliamentary chiefs, commanding a majority in the Irish
House of Commons. In this honest recognition of facts and terms we
have an advance on the vagueness of former proposals. Otherwise, both
this Parliament and this Executive are to have the same liberty and
are to be restrained by almost precisely the same checks and
safeguards, in regard both to religious rights and Imperial
sovereignty, as those which existed in the Home Rule Bills of 1886 and
1893. Ireland is to retain at Westminster a representation of
forty-two members.</p>

<p>What is to happen if the two Irish Chambers differ? According to the
Bill, the Senate is to be nominated, at first by the Imperial
Government, and afterwards by the Irish Parliament, and the members
are to sit by rotation for eight years. The Irish House of Commons, on
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>other hand, is to be elected by the same constituencies as at
present, and the membership is to be distributed in proportion to the
population&mdash;an arrangement which will give Ulster fifty-nine
representatives.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It is clear that under those conditions a
powerful Irish Government remaining in office beyond a certain period
would have command of both Houses, as indeed happens at present under
similar conditions both in Canada and New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But if one
Party should hold power for a prolonged period, and then give place to
another, the new Government will find itself, as Mr. Borden finds
himself in Canada at present, restrained from precipitate change by an
Upper House nominated by his predecessors.</p>

<p>What would happen in that case? To settle that problem, the Home Rule
Bill contains a clause<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> adopting the provisions of the South Africa
Act, enabling both Houses to hold a joint sitting, in which the
majority will prevail. As long as that provision holds, it matters
very little whether the Upper Chamber is nominated or is elected, as
some propose, by proportional representation. In either case, the
Irish House of Commons will be the real governing body, as indeed it
must be if the Irish Executive is to be properly responsible, and the
new Irish Constitution to work smoothly.</p>

<p>So much for the general provisions of the present Bill. The details as
to safe-guards and exclusions will be found in the full text of the
Bill contained in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>, and I shall leave the question of
finance to the chapter specifically devoted to that subject.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Let us turn now to the chief arguments against the measure as set
forth in the recent debate, and as expressed with ability and power in
a pamphlet entitled "Against Home Rule," to which practically all the
chief leaders of the Unionist cause contribute articles<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Apart
from the Ulster case, dealt with in a previous chapter, the main
argument seems to be that the English people have not been
sufficiently consulted. "It is all so sudden," said the elderly lady
when she received a proposal from an elderly suitor who had been
delaying his passion for a score or so of years. The same painful
outcry comes from the Unionist Party twenty-seven years after the
first beginning of the discussions of Home Rule in this country.</p>

<p>One can imagine, indeed, that a foreign visitor, coming to this land
in ignorance of the past of English politics, would suppose that the
Home Rule controversy had now arisen for the first time. Attending
Unionist meetings, he would hear an immense amount of eloquence
devoted to the wrongs of the English people in being rushed into a
premature decision, and being asked to give judgment without proper
trial. The Home Rulers would be represented to him as men of rash and
precipitate temper, who wanted to bring about in a few months a change
which would affect the United Kingdom for centuries. And finally he
would hear men thanking God that there existed a House of Lords which,
in spite of the machinations of the Home Rulers, could still give the
British public two more years to ruminate over the question of Home
Rule.</p>

<p>He would naturally gather from this that the proposal of Home Rule for
Ireland had come upon this country with entire freshness, and had
never before been discussed <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>among rational men. Filled with this
impression he might perhaps be surprised if he obtained the chance of
hearing the "still, small voice" of truth through the clamour and the
uproar, to discover that this plan of Home Rule was not born
yesterday, but no less than twenty-five years ago. He would find that
for a whole generation every nook and cranny of this proposal has been
meticulously explored, and that there have been on this subject
thousands, if not millions, of speeches and leading articles, hundreds
of books, and dozens of Parliamentary debates. He would even learn
from many politicians that their chief difficulty was the utter
boredom of their constituents over a subject which has been worn down
by argument to the very threads.</p>

<p>But he would be more surprised than all to discover that this proposal
had already been considered in at least four General Elections&mdash;1886,
1892, and the two elections of 1910.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> "It has been deliberately
rejected by the people on two occasions" would be the cry which he
would hear most commonly from his Tory friends, and he would find that
they referred to the elections of 1886 and 1895. Our friend the
foreigner would naturally be impressed by that argument. But what
would be his amazement to discover that his informants had forgotten
to enlighten him on the equally important fact that Home Rule had been
definitely accepted and approved by the British electorate, not in
two, but in three elections&mdash;the election of 1892 and the two
elections of 1910? He would discover that on all these three occasions
the subject had been definitely placed before them, that on all three
occasions the electorate had definitely supported Home Rule, by
majorities varying from forty in 1892 to 124 in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>December, 1910. As to
the other General Elections, might not our foreigner reflect that if
an electorate were really to discover that its vote for the approval
of a measure was treated&mdash;as in 1892&mdash;with indifference, it might
naturally weary of well-doing?</p>

<p>Might he not even, if he were a shrewd man, suspect that that was the
very object and aim which his informants had in view?</p>

<p>But perhaps his surprise would reach its highest point when he
discovered that this Home Rule proposal, so far from appearing now for
the first time in a definite form, had actually twice before taken the
definite and statutory form of Home Rule Bills, both the specific and
considered proposals of Liberal Governments, both fully drafted and
laid before Parliament, and both still to be purchased at any
Government printers. The first of these Bills, the Bill of 1886, was,
indeed, rejected by the House of Commons on the second reading, and
never ran the gauntlet of full Parliamentary debate. But the second,
the Bill of 1893, occupied fully five months of Parliamentary time,
and was carried successfully by Mr. Gladstone through all its stages
in the House of Commons. It was amended on many points without the
interference of Government authority. It presents a full scheme of
self-government for Ireland, so clearly and minutely considered as to
provide an efficient and reasoned basis for the measure of 1912.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE BILLS OF 1886 AND 1893</h4>

<p>The aim of both these great measures&mdash;the Bills of 1886 and 1893&mdash;was
to give the Irish control of their own local affairs and to
distinguish as clearly as possible between those affairs and Imperial
matters. The method chosen in both Bills is to follow the Parnell
scheme of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>enumerating the subjects excluded from the legislative
power of the Irish Parliament. The excluding clause became
considerably enlarged in the Bill of 1893 as it was left by the House
of Commons. The 1893 Bill also contains a far more definite and
stronger assertion of Imperial authority, which is inserted
twice&mdash;first in the Preamble, and then in the second clause of the
Bill.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In both Bills there was a safeguarding clause as well as an excluding
clause. The safeguarding clause also grew considerably between 1886
and 1893. It is almost entirely directed to preventing the Irish
Legislature from establishing any new religious privileges, or
interfering with any existing religious rights. The clause, as it
emerged in 1893, not only forbade any new establishment or endowment
of religion, but seemed to leave the claims of all denominations
precisely as they stand at present.</p>

<p>This safeguarding clause reappears in the Bill of 1912, but it has
been shortened and redrafted by the Government. It contains very
important additional safeguards to prevent the adoption by the Irish
civil power of the principles contained in the recent Papal Decrees
against mixed marriages, and in regard to the right of Catholic clergy
to claim exclusion from the courts of justice. The Irish Parliament
will be debarred from acting on these decrees, and thus the whole
agitation against "Ne Temere" falls to the ground.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE TWO CHAMBERS</h4>

<p>The 1886 Bill established, as we have seen, an arrangement by which
Ireland should be governed by one legislative body consisting of two
orders, a first and a second. These orders were to deliberate and vote
together, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>except in regard to matters which should come directly
under the Home Rule Act, amendments of the Act, or Standing Orders in
pursuance of the Act. In such cases the first order possessed the
right of voting separately, and seemed to possess an absolute veto.</p>

<p>The first order of the legislative body created by the 1886 Bill
consisted of 103 members, of whom 75 were elected members and 28
peerage members. The elected members were to be chosen under a
restricted suffrage, and the peerage members were to be the
representative Irish Peers. The second order was to consist of 204
members, elected under the existing franchise.</p>

<p>All this was rather complicated and confusing, and was, perhaps
rightly, brushed aside by the framers of the 1893 Bill. They
constituted the Irish Legislature on the model of an ordinary Colonial
Parliament with two Chambers&mdash;a Legislative Assembly and a Legislative
Council. The Legislative Council was to consist of 48 members, elected
by large constituencies voting under a &pound;20 property franchise. The
Legislative Assembly was to consist of 103 members, elected by the
existing constituencies under the existing franchise. In cases of
disagreement between the two Houses, it was proposed that, either
after a dissolution or after a period of two years, the Houses were to
vote together, and that the majority vote should decide the matter.
Since 1893 that provision, in almost precisely the same form, has been
adopted by the Australian Commonwealth, and, in a more progressive
form, by, the South African Parliament.</p>

<p>In the Bill of 1912 these provisions of 1893 reappear, but in a
broader and more liberal form. The Irish Legislative Assembly and
Legislative Council&mdash;names which seem to give to Ireland a position of
a subordinate&mdash;have given way, as we have seen, to the frank and
generous <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>titles of Senate and House of Commons, both forming the
Irish Parliament. The machinery for settling disagreements has come
back from its journey round the world refreshed by a new draft of
democracy, imbibed from the climates of Australia and South Africa. In
cases of differences between the Assemblies they will meet and decide
by common vote, without the necessity of a dissolution. That is a
great and important simplification, and for it the Irish have to thank
the genius of the founders of the South African Constitution.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>IN OR OUT?</h4>

<p>Every student of the Home Rule question knows that Mr. Gladstone
several times varied his proposals in regard to the Irish
representation at Westminster. The Irish Party were, from the
beginning, indifferent on the point; but it was quite clear that this
was a matter vitally affecting Imperial interests. The first proposal
grafted into the Bill of 1886 was that the Irish should cease to
attend at Westminster altogether. But, after seven years of
consideration, there grew up a general agreement that the entire
absence of the Irish Party at Westminster might create a series of
difficult relations between the Parliaments, and might even gradually
lead to separation. The first proposal of the Bill of 1893 was that
the Irish members should attend in slightly reduced numbers and vote
at Westminster only on Irish concerns. But this proposal&mdash;known as the
"In and Out" clause&mdash;found little favour in debate, and suffered
severely at the hands of Mr. Chamberlain. Mr. Gladstone finally left
the matter to the judgment of the House of Commons, and&mdash;after a
severe Parliamentary crisis, in which the Government narrowly escaped
destruction&mdash;it was decided that 80 Irish members should sit in the
British House of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Commons without any restriction of their power or
authority.</p>

<p>In the Bill of 1912 the solution finally reached in 1893 is again
adopted, with one vital difference&mdash;that the Irish members to be
summoned to Westminster will be reduced not to 80, but to 42. Those
members will possess full Parliamentary powers, as indeed it is right
and necessary they should, as long as the Parliament at Westminster
continues to exercise such large powers over Ireland. But Mr. Asquith
threw out the suggestion that the British House of Commons should, by
its Standing Orders, arrange for a further delegation of Parliamentary
power to national groups. The House of Commons has already a Scotch
Committee, and to that might be added an English Committee and a Welsh
Committee. It would be a serious thing for the central body to
over-ride the opinions of these committees.</p>

<p>But Mr. Asquith also threw out an even more important hint as to the
future development of the Home Rule policy. It is clear that if the
Irish Home Rule Bill is simply the first stage in a process which will
lead to the creation of Home Rule Parliaments for local affairs in
Scotland, England and Wales, then such slight control as the 42 Irish
members may retain over British affairs will be only temporary. What,
then, is the present Parliamentary relationship between Irish Home
Rule and the Federal idea?</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE NEW FEDERALISM</h4>

<p>Since the year 1893 there has been a great change of feeling in regard
to the whole Home Rule question. The British Parliament has gone
through a great crisis in its procedure, and it has, for the moment,
accepted a temporary way out in the form of a drastic use of the
closure, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>applied by Mr. Balfour, under Standing Orders, to so vital a
matter as Supply. That violent remedy known as the "Compartment
Closure" is now almost automatically extended by both parties, under
the very thin veil of liberty left by a special resolution, to almost
every great measure that comes before the House of Commons.</p>

<p>This development of the British Parliamentary system has created a new
outlook on the Home Rule question. The case of Ireland still stands by
itself, with great grievances and strong historical claims behind it.
Home Rule for Ireland will always have a peculiar urgency, arising
from conditions of geographical position. But the passion for Irish
liberty is now mingled in the average British mind with the passion
for the liberty of the British House of Commons. It is recognised that
unless Ireland is freed the British Parliament will remain in chains.</p>

<p>This new attitude has widened the outlook of Home Rulers until Home
Rule has ceased to be a merely Irish question. Nothing was more
dramatic during the recent debates over the Insurance Bill than the
sudden wave of federal feeling in the House of Commons which compelled
the Government to grant a separate administrative insurance authority,
not merely to Ireland, but also to Scotland and Wales. Similarly with
Home Rule. What was in 1893 only a pale glimmer of foresight, is with
many, in the year 1912, a passionate conviction. It is that after Home
Rule has been given to Ireland it must be extended also to Scotland,
Wales, and possibly England.</p>

<p>Now it would be plainly useless to grant Home Rule to any of these
countries until there is a wider and deeper demand for it. The issue
of Home Rule for Ireland was definitely raised in both the elections
of 1910, and when the people gave their votes they knew, and were
actually <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>warned by Mr. Balfour himself, and by most of the other
Unionist chiefs, that the result would be the creation of a Home Rule
Parliament in Ireland. But it cannot be said that the same proposal
was so definitely and effectively put forward in regard to Scotland
and Wales. In both those countries there is a very widespread desire
for Home Rule. But there has not yet been any definite democratic vote
on that desire. It may be necessary, therefore, to delay the extension
of Home Rule to those countries. But the desire is sufficiently strong
both in Scotland and in Wales to justify the Government in so framing
a Home Rule Bill as to enable those other parts of the United Kingdom
to be brought under its provisions in due time. There is a strict
analogy for that proceeding in the North America Act of 1867, which
created the Dominion of Canada. That Act joined together three
provinces at first, but left the door open for other provinces to come
in. They have since come in, one by one&mdash;all except the island of
Newfoundland&mdash;until the great federation of States which we now know
as the Canadian Dominion has been gradually built up.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>What follows from all this? Surely that a Home Rule Bill for Ireland
must be so framed as to render it a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>possible basis of a federal
Constitution in the near future. But if the Irish members were
entirely excluded from the British Parliament, as in 1886, then we
should be turning our backs on Federalism. The only analogy to such a
Constitution would be that of Austria-Hungary, where two countries are
united in one Government, but work through two Parliaments. Lord
Morley tells us that Mr. Parnell was very anxious to imitate in the
1886 Bill the ingenious machinery of "Delegations," by which the
relations of the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments combine for common
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>There is much to be said for that machinery in Austria-Hungary,
strongly binding together two countries which must otherwise have
inevitably drifted asunder. But Mr. Parnell was thinking only of
Ireland, and he was not a Federalist. We are thinking of the whole
United Kingdom, and many of us are Federalists. The machinery of
"Delegations" therefore would not suit our purpose.</p>

<p>What seems to be required ultimately at Westminster is a small
Parliament devoted to Imperial affairs&mdash;Imperial finance, Imperial
legislation, and Imperial administration&mdash;and leaving to subordinate
Parliaments the administration of local matters. Many are firmly
convinced that in that way the United Kingdom would become a more
successful and efficient country, with legislation better adapted to
the needs of its inhabitants, and with a mind more free for the
consideration of great Imperial affairs. This now seems to them the
only way to produce order out of the present constitutional chaos.</p>

<p>What, then, are the lines that should be followed if we are to go
forward to that goal? An Imperial Parliament of that nature would
probably be a smaller <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>assembly than the present House of Commons,
which is far too large for modern conditions. There is, therefore,
good ground for reducing the representation of Ireland to 42, or 38
less than in 1893. That will clear the way for a future Imperial
assembly of between 300 and 400, it being understood that as each
section of the United Kingdom obtains its own Home Rule Parliament it
will consent to have its representation at Westminster reduced in
proportion.</p>

<p>As long as the present system of Cabinet Government resting on
majorities exists&mdash;and it is the only conceivable system for a
completely self-governing democracy&mdash;it still seems, as it seemed to
the men of 1893, impossible to agree to any "in and out" arrangement.
Under such a plan the Government might possess a majority on Imperial
or English affairs, while it could be out-voted on Irish affairs.
Although such a situation might conceivably work for a time, it might
come to a sudden deadlock in a moment of emergency. It seems best,
therefore, that the 42 Irish members at Westminster should possess
full voting powers. If any Liberal dreads the prospect of having 42
Irish members still possibly giving votes hostile to Liberal
views&mdash;say, on education&mdash;I would ask him to remember that the Liberal
Party will not have to mourn the loss of Irish votes still almost
certain to be cast in their favour on behalf of many democratic
measures.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>The prospect of this larger federal settlement opens a larger vision
than that of 1886 or 1893. Strangely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>enough, it is the same vision as
that sketched by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain in the daring speech which he
made on the second reading of the Home Rule Bill of 1886:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"In my view the solution of this question should be sought in
some form of federation, which would really maintain the
Imperial unity, and which would, at the same time, conciliate
the desire for a national local government which is felt so
strongly in Ireland. I say I believe it is on this line, and
not on the line of our relations with our self-governing
Colonies, that it is possible to seek for and to find a
solution of this difficulty."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></div>

which they spring, and at the same time to adopt on our part
every reasonable measure for disarming those fears."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h3>HOME RULE DIFFICULTIES<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>"Sooner or later," said a wise man to me the other day, "always sooner
or later in the Home Rule question you bump up against religion." That
is, unhappily, still true, though not so true to-day as in 1886 or in
1893. No one who visits Ireland to-day can doubt that the religious
hatreds of the past are being softened; but, unhappily, this process,
as recent events have vividly shown us, is still fiercely resisted by
a small minority.</p>

<p>It may almost be said that in Ireland religious intolerance is a
political vested interest. It would indeed be impossible to justify
the immense preponderance of salaried power and place still given at
the centre to the Protestant minority<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> unless you could maintain
the idea <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>that the Catholic is a dangerous man when in a place of
power. That consideration, doubtless largely unconscious, may yet
partly explain the immense amount of energy devoted in the north-east
of Ireland to the encouragement of religious prejudice&mdash;honest in many
of the rank-and-file, artificial, I fear, in many of the organisers.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>BELFAST</h4>

<p>Belfast, so like a great modern city in its magnificent outward
aspect, is still largely medi&aelig;val at heart. Its chief social energies
are thrown into that vast and powerful organisation known as the
"Orange Society"&mdash;still wearing the badges of the seventeenth century,
still uttering its war-cries, and still feeding on its passions. This
immense religious club has to support in the modern age that theory of
religious incompatibility which nearly every other community has long
ago abandoned. It has to justify itself in excluding from the
municipal honours of Belfast almost every Roman Catholic. It has to
justify the majority of 300,000 Belfast Protestants in giving a small
and inadequate representation among the rulers of this great wealthy
town to the minority of 100,000 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Catholics. To maintain this policy of
Ulster ascendancy the Orange chiefs watch every document that comes
from Rome with a lynx eye, and try to catch a glimpse of the "Scarlet
Woman" behind every Latin rescript.</p>

<p>All this may appear to some good politics; but surely it is past
tolerance when these manufacturers of intolerance talk of the
intolerance of others.</p>

<p>In all these respects Belfast stands almost alone in Ireland. A canon
of the Catholic Church&mdash;a man of winning manners and charming
personality, who lives on quite friendly terms with his Protestant
neighbours in the South of Ireland&mdash;told me that on the only occasion
when he visited Belfast he was spat at in the streets. The story is
quite credible to those who have watched the deliberate manipulation
of the worst religious passions by the party organisers of Ulster, not
always unassisted by their colleagues in London.</p>

<p>One result is that if you ask any question as to the character of a
man in the city of Belfast, the answer will always come to you in
terms of religion. In the South the reply will be, "He is a
Nationalist," or "He is a Unionist." But in Belfast it will be, "He is
a Catholic," or "He is a Protestant."</p>

<p>So fierce is this feeling in Belfast that until recently all political
and social differences were submerged by it, and every fresh effort
towards local progress was broken up by the revival of religious
prejudice. Things have been somewhat changed by the wonderful social
and political crusade, quite independent of all religious differences,
carried on by that remarkable young citizen of Belfast, Mr. Joseph
Devlin, who captured the constituency of West Belfast in 1906 and
retained it in 1910 largely on a social reform policy. He has for the
first time given Ulster a glimpse of something better than <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>religious
fanaticism&mdash;a social policy based on the unions of religions for the
good of all.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>This break in the dark clouds must surely spread until a better spirit
prevails.</p>

<p>For Belfast, perhaps, has more to gain than any other great Irish city
by a policy that would pacify Ireland. If Belfast could once shake off
the memory of her immigrant origin, and look to Ireland rather than
Great Britain as her native country, she would perceive that the gain
of Catholic Ireland must be her gain also. Her prosperity can never be
sure or certain as long as it stands out against a background of Irish
poverty. The linen industry can never rest secure as long as there are
so few industries to support it. The linen merchants cannot really
gain by their isolation. Belfast at present has a great export trade.
She clothes Great Britain in fine linen. But what about her home
trade? Would not Belfast be even more prosperous if she could clothe
Ireland too?&mdash;if Ireland could afford to put aside her rags and
replace them with "purple and fine linen" from the factories of the
North?</p>

<p>Might not Belfast, in that case, be able not merely to enrich her
merchants but to raise the social conditions of her own people? For it
is unhappily the case that the researches of the Women's Trade Unions
have disclosed in Belfast conditions of sweated labour that have
surprised and alarmed even the most hardened investigators. The lofty
buildings and humming mills of Belfast are revealed to be resting on a
swamp of social misery. Nor <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>is this at all remarkable, for the mass
of the people are kept helpless and divided by their religious
divisions, which are too often used as a weapon to prevent them from
combining for higher wages and shorter hours. Religious fanaticism is
not quite so self-sacrificing in its commercial results as superficial
observers might suppose.</p>

<p>It is impossible, indeed, that Belfast can continue for ever in a
prosperity isolated and aloof from the country in which she is
situated. Either she must throw in her lot with Ireland or Ireland
must drag Ireland down into one common pit of adversity. Lord Pirrie,
the enterprising and fearless director of the great shipbuilding works
on Queen's Island&mdash;works which maintained their pre-eminence and
continued their output through the dark days of the shipbuilding trade
on the Clyde and the Thames&mdash;has been converted to Home Rule. Other
business men will follow his example, for Belfast, as much as any
other town in Ireland, suffers in Private Bill legislation from the
remoteness of the Legislature and the Administration. She, too, has
too often to endure a financial policy not suited to her needs. She,
like the rest of Ireland, has everything to gain and nothing to lose
by a policy that will enable Ireland to obtain legislation better
fitted to the needs of the Irish people.</p>

<p>In spite, indeed, of her outcries, Ulster has already gained more from
the policy of the Nationalists at Westminster than from that of the
Orange reactionaries who represent half the province at Westminster.
Those Orangemen have identified the robust Radicalism and
Presbyterianism of Ulster with the narrowest demands of the Anglican
landlords and Tories of England. Happily for Ulster, they have been
defeated. The farmers of Ulster are at present buying their farms
under the policy of Land Purchase which the Orange Ulstermen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>resisted. These farmers have freely used the Land Courts which their
representatives denounced as revolution and the "end of all things."
They are profiting by the triumphs of Nationalist policy even while
they denounce the Nationalists in terms which are reserved by other
people for criminals and wild beasts.</p>

<p>The best men in Ulster will probably think twice before prolonging a
campaign of rebellion. We have heard of late threats of refusal to pay
taxes or rents to the Irish Parliament. But what could be more
dangerous to a city like Belfast than a no-rent campaign under the
guidance of English lawyers? If the farmers are advised not to pay
their rents to Dublin, is it not likely that the working-class tenants
of Belfast may refuse to pay their rents to their own landlords? At
their own peril, indeed, will a class which largely lives on rent and
interest strike a blow at the habits and customs which enforce such
payments. The kid-glove revolution of linen merchants might suddenly
and swiftly turn into something nearer to the real, red thing. It is
dangerous to set examples in revolution.</p>

<p>As Ulster gradually swings round to the inevitable, she will discover
that there is a very bright silver lining to what seems to her so
black a cloud. Ulster, while still represented at Westminster, will
send 59 members to Dublin under the 1912 Bill. Thus she will have no
small or mean representation in the future Irish Parliament. She may
have far more power than she imagines, if she uses it with wisdom. A
strong Progressive section from the industrial North may hold the
balance between the parties of the South and centre. It would be rash
to predict the future. But there are many causes&mdash;education, Free
Trade, enlightened local government, to take a few&mdash;in which Ireland
will gain immensely by a strong, clear <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>progressive lead. "The best is
yet to be." Why should not Belfast&mdash;Belfast Protestant united with
Belfast Catholic&mdash;have in these matters a greater and nobler part to
play under Home Rule than under the present system of distant,
ignorant, absent-minded, rule?</p>

<p>As for religious persecution, the thing would be absurdly impossible
under any Home Rule Bill that possessed the guarantees and safeguards
of the 1912 Bill. But, beyond those safeguards, Ulster will always
have, in any such extreme and improbable event, an appeal to all the
forces of the Empire&mdash;an appeal which would certainly not be in vain.</p>

<p>The conviction of these truths will gradually penetrate the shrewd
brain of Ulster and save her from the madness of rebellion or
secession. The patience and moderation of the Government will
gradually disarm these men. Who knows whether in the end the majority
in Belfast, as in Ulster, as a whole may not voluntarily prefer to
join rather than hold aloof from a great national restoration?</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>In one of his 1893 Home Rule speeches, Mr. Gladstone reminded the
House of Commons, with impressive power, of the splendid reception
given in 1793 to the Protestant delegates from Grattan's Parliament at
Dublin, who had come to plead for the concession of their rights to
the Catholics of Ireland.</p>

<p>It was the Act of Union that destroyed all that generous feeling, and
revived again the passions of ascendancy and fanaticism among the
Orangemen of North-east Ulster.</p>

<p>But the old, generous feelings may yet return again.</p>

<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><br />
<h4>SOUTHERN ULSTER</h4>

<p>The great majority of the Protestants in Ireland stand outside this
ring. They have no more share in the good things than the average
Catholic. Those men, Irishmen first and Protestants afterwards, are
now taking their part in public life and earning their proper share in
the rewards of public zeal.</p>

<p>The delegates of the Eighty Club made a special public appeal for
information as to cases of religious intolerance. They received a
great many responses to this appeal, but it is hardly any exaggeration
to say that they found no genuine cases of religious intolerance
outside the North-east corner of Ulster, where they received some
conspicuous examples of the religious persecution of Liberal
Protestants by their Orange co-religionists.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Journeying southwards, however, the Eighty Club delegates passed with
every mile into a serener atmosphere. They received deputations at
every wayside station from the public bodies in the south of Ulster.
These presented documents stating the bare facts as to the
representation of these two forms of the Christian religion&mdash;so often,
alas! belying the doctrine of Christian love by the practice of mutual
hatred&mdash;on their public bodies. They found, for instance, in Monaghan,
a predominantly Catholic town, that seven seats on the local Council
went to the Unionist and Protestant Party, a considerable concession
from a majority large enough in numbers to pack the whole of the
council if they so desired. That little town might give a good lesson
to some of the boroughs of our great county of London, where it is an
almost <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>universal practice for either party to seize the whole of the
seats if they are capable of doing so.</p>

<p>Take one more instance in that district&mdash;out of the many&mdash;in the town
of Cavan, a preponderantly Catholic borough. There, out of
twenty-three candidates at the last election standing for eighteen
seats, four Unionists were elected by a similar method of compromise.
Where is the evidence of the Orangemen in their strongholds meting out
similar measure to the Catholics?</p>

<p>Passing further south they found that although the great majority of
the public bodies was naturally Nationalist and Catholic, there was no
sign of that spirit of rigid exclusiveness extended towards the
Catholics by the Protestants in the city of Belfast. Of course, a
large number of the Protestant officials found so frequently in the
service of these public bodies are appointed in Ireland by the Crown,
and not, as in England, by the local authorities. But the Protestants
are not confined to those offices. Dublin has several times freely
elected a Protestant to the Lord Mayoralty of that city. In other
parts of southern Ireland the Eighty Club found Protestants as masters
in the county schools, surveyors of taxes, local registrars, clerks of
the works, rate collectors, and public librarians. The Catholics on
the local bodies recognise that the Protestants in the south possess,
owing to their superior advantages in education, a great proportion of
the brains, and they are not slow to do justice to this fact in
filling public posts.</p>

<p>In regard to elections, let us be quite candid. It is not to be
expected that an Irish elector will return at the head of the poll men
who hurl abuse and calumny at the Irish race and at the religion held
by the great majority of the Irish race. Treachery to one's cause and
one's faith is not required by any proper doctrine of tolerance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Surrender is not the same thing as compromise. We do not, for
instance, expect in England that a Unionist constituency should return
a Liberal, or a Liberal constituency should return a Tory. We expect
men to live up to their faith, and even admire them for doing so. In
Ireland, similarly, Nationalist voters, as a whole, prefer Nationalist
members, and will continue to do so until this great issue of Home
Rule is settled.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>CHANCES OF PEACE</h4>

<p>But when a Unionist or a Protestant comes forward with a single eye to
the public good, and displays in public affairs a broad and generous
spirit, he finds no difficulty in securing his place in public life.
In county Cork and Tipperary we found Protestant landlords who had
sold their estates. Having ceased to be rent collectors, they are
becoming real leaders of their people. These landlords are
reorganising co-operative societies, encouraging agricultural
experiments, looking after schools, and helping generally in the
regrowth of Ireland with a real good will. Many of these men are
Devolutionists. Take, for instance, Sir Nugent Everard, the
public-spirited squire who, with great enterprise, enthusiasm, and
perseverance, is reviving that old Irish tobacco industry which once
played so big a part in the prosperity of Ireland. Sir Nugent Everard
is a Protestant, but he has been elected to his county council. On
that council, too, he has been appointed chairman of several
committees by his Catholic fellow county councillors.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, at the present moment throughout the south of
Ireland a new spirit of willingness, amounting almost to eagerness, to
accept the services of all distinguished Protestants who will work for
the common <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>good of Ireland. That is not at all surprising when we
remember that the Irish Party have, in the past, numbered among their
leaders at least three distinguished Protestants&mdash;Grattan, Butt, and
Parnell&mdash;and at the present day always return a steady percentage of
Protestant representatives to the Imperial Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The plain fact is that, except in the north-east corner, religious
intolerance is a dying cause in Ireland, and even in Belfast it is
mainly kept alive by artificial respiration frequently administered by
English Unionist leaders.</p>

<p>Every phase of Irish life is expressed in Irish humour. Two Irish
stories commonly related to-day in the south really throw some light
on the change of feeling in Ireland. One is that of a Protestant
parson in the south who found that the Bishop was about to visit his
parish for a confirmation. But, unhappily, it so happened that there
were no young people to confirm. The parson was in despair. After long
reflection, he took a great decision. He went across to the Catholic
priest and described his unhappy plight. "Indeed," he said, "I shall
be a ruined man." "Sure," said the priest sympathetically, "I will
lend you a congregation." "How will you do that?" said the parson.
"Faith! I'll tell the boys and girls to go across." And the story
relates that when the Bishop came down he actually found the church
full of "boys and girls" who, for the moment, figured as Protestants.</p>

<p>The second story comes from Ulster, and seems to show that there is
some softening even in the rigour of that climate. It is said that
"once upon a time," when July <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>11th came round one of the Orange
drummers found that on the last occasion he had broken his drum, and
could not get it mended. Finding himself faced with disgrace, he
wandered through the town after a drum, and finally found himself
looking at a very beautiful specimen of its kind standing in a
Catholic schoolroom. After much heart-searching, the Orangeman at last
went in, and timidly told the Catholic priest the extremity of his
Protestant need. "You shall have the drum," said the priest; "but you
must not break it this time." And so, on that condition, the drum was
handed over.</p>

<p>Perhaps if such relations were to become more common the drums would
actually beat more softly in the north of Ireland.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Take the facts given by Mr. John J. Horgan, in his
interesting pamphlet entitled "Home Rule&mdash;A Critical
Consideration":&mdash;"In a country of which three-fourths of the population
are Catholic there has not been a Catholic Viceroy since 1688. There
never was a Catholic Chief Secretary. There have been three Catholic
Under-Secretaries. There have been two Catholic Chancellors. In the
High Court of Justice there are seventeen Judges; <i>three</i> of them are
Catholics. There are twenty-one County Court Judges and Recorders;
eight of them are Catholics. There are thirty-seven County Inspectors
of Police; five of them are Catholics. There are 202 District
Inspectors of Police; sixty-two of them are Catholics. There are over
5,000 Justices of the Peace; a little more than one-fifth of them are

<p>"Let us now consider some of the large Government Departments. Take
the Local Government Board. This body consists of two elements&mdash;the
nominated and highly paid officials and those who secure admission
through competitive examinations. From the latter class Catholics
cannot, of course, be excluded. The permanent Vice-President is to all
intents and purposes the Local Government Board. He is a Protestant
and a Unionist. Of the three Commissioners, two are Protestants, one a
Catholic. On the permanent staff we find forty-seven nominated
officials, thirty-four of whom are Protestants: and the balance of
thirteen Catholics. The thirty-four Protestants draw an average yearly
salary of &pound;653 13s., while the average yearly salary of the thirteen
Catholic officials only amounts to &pound;580. On the permanent staff
created by competitive examination the story is very different. Here
we find forty-three Catholics and twenty-five Protestants. Brains and
ability could not be kept out. But what about their remuneration? The
average salary of the forty-three Catholics amounts to &pound;207 13s. 6d.,
while that of the twenty-five Protestants is &pound;304 8s. Can any sensible
man believe that there is no favour here?"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The result is that since 1906 Ulster has been half
Nationalist in its Parliamentary representation. Taking the last three

17; Unionist, 16. 1910 (January): Nationalist and Liberal, 15;

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h3>HOME RULE DIFFICULTIES<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Those who watch closely the exploitation of the religious cry against
Home Rule will have observed that its exploiters always endeavour to
make the best of both worlds. One world is expressed in the phrase,
"Home Rule means Rome Rule." The other by the watchword,
"Priest-ridden Ireland." Those who use the first of these cries are
always trying to persuade themselves that the gift of Home Rule will
increase the power of the Catholic Church in Ireland and produce a
kind of religious tyranny over the Protestant minority. How that could
be done under a measure so carefully safeguarded as, for instance, the
Bill of 1912,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> they never condescend to tell us. It is part of
their policy never to enter into details, but to produce a general
atmosphere of distrust and unreason.</p>

<p>But it is often these very same people who draw terrible pictures of
the power of the Roman Catholic Church already existing in Ireland at
the present moment. They do not explain how both of these propositions
can be true&mdash;how, if Ireland is already "priest-ridden"&mdash;a superlative
phrase&mdash;without Home Rule, there is any room for an increase of that
evil under Home Rule. They never seem to contemplate the possibility
that the proper and natural corrective to the power of the priest, if
it be excessive, is the creation of a strong rival civil power.</p>

<p>Is it, indeed, so certain that "Home Rule" would increase the power of
Rome in Ireland? I have even <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>heard it said that the Home Rule cause
finds its headquarters at Rome, and that it is part of a gigantic
conspiracy of the Vatican to break up a Protestant Empire. Do those
who reason thus ever reflect how it is that the English Catholics are
often among the most formidable opponents of the Home Rule cause?</p>

<p>Why are the English Catholics so often opposed to Home Rule? The
answer was given by Cardinal Manning in the famous phrase quoted by
Lord Morley: "We want every one of their eighty votes."</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>UNIONISM AS "ROME RULE"</h4>

<p>Those who fear Home Rule as "Rome Rule" in Ireland had better, indeed,
examine themselves as to whether their action in defeating the Home
Rule Bill of 1893 has not, so far as it goes, led to this very same
effect in England. It must never be forgotten that it was with the
help of the 80 Irish votes, pressed back to Westminster by the Irish
Bishops in sympathy with the Catholic Bishops in England, that the
British Parliament passed those clauses of the 1902 Education Act
which are most offensive to English Nonconformists. Dr. Clifford has
coined the expression "Rome on the rates." It is not, perhaps, a
phrase that tells the whole story. We cannot forget how many of the
poorer Catholics in our great cities are the descendants of the
unhappy Irishmen who were evicted between 1840 and 1880 from the
cabins of Ireland. Those poor exiles have a special call on our
purses. But Anglicanism&mdash;rich Anglicanism&mdash;has also been placed on the
rates. It has been placed there through a working alliance between the
English Church and Rome, carrying out its aims by means of the votes
of the Catholic Irish members. Those members only <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>acted up to their
principles in so voting. It was Great Britain that compelled them to
remain as full voters in full strength at the British Parliament. As
long as they are there the Irish must be expected to vote for the
interests of their own religion and their own people. But what of the
sincerity of the people who, after using the aid of the Irish to endow
the Catholic and Anglican schools in England, now raise this outcry
about "Rome Rule" in Ireland?</p>

<p>It is vital, indeed, to point out that in these matters Home Rule for
Ireland is the only possible road to Home Rule for England also. Under
the 1912 Bill the Irish vote at Westminster is reduced to 42, and
will, if English self-government be also extended, be excluded from
education altogether. Thus the first plain and practical result of
Irish Home Rule would be not so much to give the Roman Catholics more
power in Ireland as to give the Protestants more liberty in England.
But who can doubt that it would also introduce a new element of civil
power into the schools of Ireland?<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>NATIONALISM AND RELIGION</h4>

<p>As to Ireland itself, indeed, there can be no doubt that the great
national wrongs of the Irish people have immensely strengthened the
hold of the Roman Catholic Church over that island during the last
century.</p>

<p>Let us look back for a moment at the historic relations between Roman
Catholicism and the Irish National cause.</p>

<p>No doubt the iron hammer of Cromwell&mdash;in England the rebel, in Ireland
the conqueror&mdash;and the long torture <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>of the penal laws both
contributed to weld together the religious and political faith of
Ireland. During those dark days, Nationalism and Catholicism were
almost identical terms. It has been shrewdly remarked that Henry VIII.
and Elizabeth might probably have converted Ireland to Protestantism
if they had preached the reformed faith in the Irish language. However
that may be, it is quite certain that Protestantism stood throughout
the eighteenth century as the sign and uniform of the conqueror and
the devastator. Catholicism remained as the hope and sign of the
conquered. Any Irishman who became a Protestant was naturally
suspected of being a traitor, not merely to his religion but also to
his nation.</p>

<p>Yet at the end of the eighteenth century the British Government had a
great opportunity of dividing the national from the religious cause.
Grattan's Parliament, with all its brilliancy and efficiency, was,
after all, a Parliament from which every Catholic was excluded. That
Parliament, indeed, as we have noted, granted the franchise to the
Catholic peasant and abolished the penal laws. But it was part of the
policy of the British Government to show that Grattan's Parliament
could not grant Catholic emancipation in its full sense. The grant was
to be kept as a bribe by which to achieve the policy of the Union.
Anyone who reads the story in the pages of Lecky<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> must see how that
motive ran like a sinister thread throughout the whole working of
British policy from 1795 to 1800.</p>

<p>Well, that policy succeeded only too thoroughly for the time. Among
the various forms of bribery which induced the Irish Parliament to
give a vote for the Union <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>at the second time of asking, the gift of
money and titles were, perhaps, less powerful than the offer of
Catholic emancipation. Recent researches have shown that that offer
led to the conversion of Bishops and their clergy throughout the whole
of Ireland, besides winning over the great body of Catholic Peers.</p>

<p>It is now known, indeed, to be the fact that the British Government
actually induced the Vatican to bring pressure upon the Irish leaders
and the Irish bishops in order to achieve their object. It is almost
certain that unless that offer had been made, and unless the Catholic
Party in Ireland had been informed that the Act of Union was the
inevitable price for Catholic emancipation, Lord Castlereagh would
never have succeeded in closing the Irish Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>That bargain was broken. It is unhappily the case that the British
Ministers must have given their pledge to the Catholic Party in
Ireland with the conscious knowledge of their inability to carry it
out. For over them all was their King, George III., still with the
Royal privilege of dismissal for his Ministers, and resolutely,
fiercely resolved not to grant Catholic emancipation. Pitt relieved
his conscience by a two-years' resignation, but he returned to
Parliament without achieving his pledge. For another thirty years the
struggle went on. It is the Duke of Wellington himself who has handed
down to history the testimony that Catholic emancipation was only
finally granted in 1829 in order to save Ireland from a second
rebellion.</p>

<p>It is that record that has driven Ireland into the arms of Rome, and
who can wonder?</p>

<p>England has now only paid the price of that great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>betrayal of 1800&mdash;a
betrayal almost as great as the broken treaty of Limerick. Those who
read the story of 1800 to 1830, and especially the brilliant sketch of
O'Connell's life in Lecky's "Leaders of Irish Public Opinion," will
know that it was in the course of this prolonged struggle for Catholic
emancipation that the forces of religion and politics were first
thrown into close alliance in Ireland. It was not until after 1820
that the Catholic priest took the place of the Irish landlord, and
became what he was throughout most of the nineteenth century, the
political leader of his district. It was O'Connell who first carried
out that great revolution in political strategy. It was he who first
placed the flocks of the Irish people under the guidance of shepherds
who carried the crook and not the rent-book. If the Home Rule movement
has been assisted by religious fervour, that has been the fault of
British statesmen. If the Irish have stood apart from the rest of
Europe by a steadily deepening loyalty to their faith, the reason is
largely to be found in the British policy of 1800.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>ROME AND HOME RULE</h4>

<p>What is the moral of all this? Some of the Unionists themselves give a
shrewd though cynical comment on the situation when they suggest, in
the intervals of crying "Home Rule means Rome Rule," that probably the
Roman Catholic priests have no great zeal for Home Rule. I do not,
myself, for a moment believe that that is the case. The Roman Catholic
priests of Ireland have themselves been elevated and purified by the
great struggle, both social and political, through which they have
passed. They stand apart from the rest of the priesthood of Europe,
distinguished above all others by their deep and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>strong democratic
sympathies. When all others deserted the people of Ireland in the
black times of the '98 Rebellion, in the dark and evil days of the
famine of 1847, or through the murderous retaliations that followed,
the Irish priesthood stood staunchly by Ireland. Those who remained
faithful then are not likely to desert the cause of their people now
that it is on the verge of success. A broader and more enlightened
view of the future was expressed to me by that distinguished man the
Vice-president of Maynooth College, when he said:&mdash;"We do not expect
any direct gain for our faith, but as Irishmen we are with Ireland,
and as Catholics we cannot but believe that the prosperity of a
Catholic nation must redound to the glory of Catholicism." That is the
view of a good Catholic who is also a good citizen.</p>

<p>But though we may believe in their resisting power to this great
temptation, we must remember that the failure to settle the Home Rule
question would give to the bishops and priests a great power in
Ireland. They would remain the great, pre-eminent centre of national
authority. Look at their position now. They are public men; they are
allowed, without envy or opposition, to maintain an unchallenged
control over the schools; they have a voice in all great public
decisions of policy, even in regard to such matters as old-age
pensions, insurance, or agriculture. The present position plays into
their hands. "Rome Rule" is far more powerful without "Home Rule."</p>

<p>So much for the Irish clergy. But what of Rome itself? Looked at from
the distance of the Seven Hills, and viewed from the standpoint of a
Church that contemplates all forms of human government with equal
indifference, always regarding only the good of their Church, is it
not possible that the acute diplomatists of the Eternal <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>City may
think that they stand to gain more by prolonging than by satisfying
the present hunger of Ireland? At present Rome holds Ireland in fee.
As long as Ireland possesses no strong secular central power she must
always lean on the authority of her bishops and archbishops. But Rome
thinks probably more of the 40,000,000 people of Britain than of the
4,000,000 of Ireland. As long as England persists in holding Ireland
in bondage she must pay to Rome some compensation. The eighty votes at
Westminster are still doing the work which Cardinal Manning required
of them. Is it likely that Rome is so beset with anxiety to drive them
across the Channel? Is it altogether unlikely that some of the more
shrewd Italian or Spanish diplomatists at the Vatican&mdash;advised,
perhaps, by their English bishops and dukes&mdash;may hope to affect the
issue rather in the Unionist than in the Home Rule direction? Such
suspicions may be entirely baseless, but it will be impossible to
disregard them entirely during the events of the next few years.</p>

<p>It would not be the first time, nor the latest since Castlereagh, when
the extreme Protestant Unionists of this country conspired with the
Tory Ultramontanes of the Vatican to traffic away the liberties of
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Amid all these doubts and perplexities we shall be wise to stick fast
to the central doctrine that civil liberty and religious liberty stand
together. This is the one truth that emerges from the history of
Europe during the last three centuries. Wherever we look&mdash;whether in
Germany, France, Holland, Scotland, or England&mdash;we see that these two
rights have always gone hand in hand.</p>

<p>Is there, indeed, a single instance in human history when the grant of
civil liberty has led to the forging of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>religious chains? Look to the
West, and note how, in the freest countries of the world&mdash;in the
United States and Canada, where there is not even a shadow of an
establishment for any form of religion&mdash;every kind of human faith
lives together in simple human brotherhood, and draws from that
brotherhood new food for the refreshment of mankind. In Ireland the
one reason why the religious quarrel has been maintained is to be
found in the absence of civil liberty. At every crisis of Ireland's
fate the passion of religious hatred has been worked&mdash;then as now&mdash;in
order to prolong civil and political despotism.</p>

<p>May we not be sure that Home Rule, instead of strengthening this evil
tendency, will weaken it? May we not be equally sure that it will take
no blood or muscle from the cause of true religion, certain to
flourish with greater richness and power where Christian love
prevails?</p>

<p>Is it possible, in short, that in Ireland alone, of all countries,
freedom should mean persecution? On the contrary, is it not far more
likely that Home Rule for Ireland will mean neither Rome Rule nor
Orange Rule, but the "rule of the best for the good of all"?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h3>HOME RULE IN HISTORY<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>What is the fact of Irish history vital to our present cause? Surely
it is this, that up to the year 1800&mdash;the year of the Act of
Union&mdash;Ireland had possessed for practically five centuries a Home
Rule Government in some shape or form. In other words, self-government
had been the rule and not the exception throughout the centuries
preceding 1800. This is a complete and sufficient answer to those who
argue that the supporters of Irish Home Rule are making a proposal of
a completely novel and revolutionary kind, without precedent in the
history of the Western world.</p>

<p>As a matter of plain fact, it was the framers of the Act of Union who
were the revolutionaries, and it is the supporters of Home Rule who
are returning to the ancient paths. The Home Rulers have five
centuries behind them, as against the one century behind the
Unionists. From the days of Simon de Montfort<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> the Irish Parliament
developed side by side with the English, growing with the growth of
English rule in Ireland, and varying with its limitations. Its powers,
indeed, were placed under a grave and serious limitation by Poynings'
Law, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>passed in the reign of Henry VII.,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and strengthened in the
reign of Mary Tudor.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> They were for a brief time entirely taken
away by Oliver Cromwell, who was, strangely enough, the first great
Unionist ruler of Ireland. Restored by Charles II., the Irish
Parliament was again limited in power by the Government of George
I.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But in 1782 it broke through all these limitations, and became
for a short brilliant period a fully self-governing Parliament.</p>

<p>We have thus the illuminating fact that, with one single
exception&mdash;and that an example eminent in English affairs, but
certainly not to be followed in Irish&mdash;every great English ruler and
monarch governed Ireland under a distinct Irish Home Rule Parliament
up to the year 1800. If Home Rule is so certain to be ruinous to
Empire, how, we may well ask, did these rulers build up the British
Empire? How did Marlborough and Clive, Chatham and Walpole, do their
great world-work with an Irish Parliament behind them? The answer is,
of course, that they did it better, and not worse, because Ireland was
so far satisfied with her fortunes as to be willing to put her full
force into the struggle for Empire.</p>

<p>For as long as Ireland possessed a Parliament she always possessed
hope.</p>

<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><br />
<h4>THE UNION CENTURY</h4>

<p>As against these five centuries, we have one century of Irish rule
under a united Parliament&mdash;1800 to 1911. One against five. But as the
one is more recent, we have here not a bad provision of material for
an answer to the question: "Which has proved in the past the best way
of governing Ireland&mdash;Union or Home Rule?"</p>

<p>In regard to the century of Union, the record lies before us, open and
palpable, a tale of disaster and tragedy almost without parallel in
the modern history of the world. We see in the statistics of Irish
population, of Irish disease, of Irish poverty during the nineteenth
century<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> a black picture of material decay that literally "cries to
Heaven" for redress.</p>

<p>Side by side with these statistics, too, we have others to clinch the
evidence which traces the cause to the Act of Union. For the
nineteenth century was no century of decay. On the contrary, in almost
every other Western country, and especially in countries of the same
racial and religious fusion&mdash;in the United States, in the United
Kingdom, and in the British Colonies&mdash;the nineteenth century was a
period of rising population, advancing commerce, and abounding
prosperity.</p>

<p>Nor is it the fact that British Ministers had any deliberate malice
against Ireland. On the contrary, many noble Englishmen worked
themselves grey during the nineteenth century in their efforts to make
the best of the Union system. Viceroy after Viceroy, and Chief
Secretary after Chief Secretary, have gone to Ireland full of hope,
and have come back converted reluctantly to the admission that their
efforts have been in vain and their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>work wasted under the present
form of Government.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For forms of government let fools contest;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whate'er is best administered is best"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">sang Pope. But there are some forms of government so bad that they
cannot be well administered. Among them is the form of government
established under the Act of Union.</p>

<p>Unionist writers who are honest enough to admit the decay of Ireland
between 1800-1900 attempt to trace it to any other cause than the Act
of Union&mdash;to over-population, to the Catholic religion, to the Irish
character, or even to the potato. But they labour in vain. If Ireland
stood alone, they might succeed. But it does not stand alone.
Precisely at the time when Ireland was decaying, all other Western
nations were flourishing. Precisely when the Irish race was withering
in Ireland, the same race, with the same religion and the same
national characteristics, was prospering exceedingly in America, and
was even contributing much of the power, skill and value for building
up the white British Colonies.</p>

<p>Unvarying progress on one side&mdash;on the other, unvarying decline, until
checked by the willingness of England to listen to the voice of
Ireland. What evidence could you have more convincing, what witnesses
more eloquent?</p>

<p>Perhaps, indeed, the most convincing statement of this very case was
given to the world, not by an Irishman or by any Liberal statesman,
but by the great Lord Salisbury. Speaking in 1865 as Lord Robert
Cecil, he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>uttered the following wise and statesmanlike summary of the
policy of the Union up to that date:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"What is the reason that a people with so bountiful a soil,
with such enormous resources (as the Irish), lag so far behind
the English in the race? Some say that it is to be found in the
character of the Celtic race, but I look to France, and I see a
Celtic race there going forward in the path of prosperity with
most rapid strides&mdash;I believe at the present moment more
rapidly than England herself. Some people say that it is to be
found in the Roman Catholic religion; but I look to Belgium,
and there I see a people second to none in Europe, except the
English, for industry, singularly prosperous, considering the
small space of country that they occupy, having improved to the
utmost the natural resources of that country, but distinguished
among all the peoples of Europe for the earnestness and
intensity of their Roman Catholic belief. Therefore, I cannot
say that the cause of the Irish distress is to be found in the
Roman Catholic religion. An hon. friend near me says that it
arises from the Irish people listening to demagogues. I have as
much dislike to demagogues as he has, but when I look to the
Northern States of America I see there people who listen to
demagogues, but who undoubtedly have not been wanting in
material prosperity. It cannot be demagogues, Romanism, or the
Celtic race. What then is it? I am afraid that the one thing
which has been peculiar to Ireland has been the Government of
England."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p></div>

<p>Nothing has occurred since 1865 to vary that judgment.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE HOME RULE FIVE</h4>

<p>So much for the one century of Union. What about the five of Home
Rule?</p>

<p>"Were there no black centuries before 1800? Had Ireland no grievances?
What of the 'curse of Cromwell,' the broken 'Treaty of Limerick,' and
the penal laws?"</p>

<p>Thus I shall be challenged.</p>

<p>There were, indeed, black centuries before 1800, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>black events.
Ireland endured a special share of the agony inflicted upon Europe by
the great religious struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries. She suffered, perhaps, more than any other country from the
divisions of Christian Europe following on the revolt of Luther
against Rome in 1520. The statutory limitations of the Irish
Parliament during that period led to many interferences from England,
and the gradual exclusion of Catholics divided the Parliament from the
Irish nation. The artificial infusion of a fanatical Protestant
population by James I. and Cromwell produced a terrible embitterment
of the struggle. There were crimes on both sides, and calamities
beyond telling. But, with all that, it is still to be doubted whether
any of those centuries presents such a picture of national decay, both
industrial and social, as is presented by the Ireland of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>For through the blackness of that night the Irish Parliament always
shone like a star. Ireland grew with its growth, and withered with its
decay. Precisely as she had more Home Rule she advanced, and precisely
as she had less she fell back. But as long as the Parliament existed
at all it could never be said that the final spark of liberty had been
stamped out.</p>

<p>Even in the eighteenth century, when Catholic Ireland seemed to be
crushed, and Ireland lay supine beneath the double weight of the penal
laws and the commercial restrictions of England&mdash;an Ireland pictured
for all time by the keen, merciless pen of Dean Swift&mdash;still the
vestal flame was not quite extinguished. Captured by ascendancy,
dominated by fanaticism, narrowed to one faith, or even to one section
of that faith, the Irish Parliament still always provided a framework
and machinery for a possible moment of regeneration and recovery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>That moment came in 1782&mdash;came, unhappily both for England and for
Ireland, in such a form as to seem to justify the hard
saying&mdash;"England's danger is Ireland's opportunity."</p>

<p>The story of 1782 has been told with surpassing brilliancy in the
greatest of all Mr. Lecky's books&mdash;the darling of his youth and the
worry of his old age&mdash;his "Leaders of Irish Public Opinion."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The
disastrous and wasting struggle against our own kith and kin in the
American colonies&mdash;forced on England by the folly of the same type of
statesmen now resisting Home Rule&mdash;had reduced these islands to an
almost defenceless condition. The British Army, intended for the
defence of Great Britain, had been sent away into the forests and
prairies of Northern America to fight an invisible foe, and to meet
with a disastrous and undeserved defeat. But in their blind passion to
subdue the Americans the British Government had for the moment
forgotten Ireland. In their eagerness to conquer their colonies they
had forgotten to maintain their hold on the half-conquered country at
their side. The British troops had been withdrawn from Ireland as well
as from England. At that dramatic moment France came into the struggle
with her fleet, and Ireland, with her great harbours and her
accessible coastline, could not be left defenceless. As Ireland had no
British troops to defend her, it was inevitable that she should be
allowed to defend herself.</p>

<p>Ireland, never slow in a fight, rose to this crisis. In a few months
there sprang up throughout the country that wonderful movement of the
Irish Volunteers. Ireland in a few weeks produced an army that kept
Europe from her shores. Sixty thousand Irishmen stood to arms.
Ireland <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>could no longer be hectored or bullied. She was, for the
moment&mdash;for the only time in her history&mdash;mistress of her own fate.</p>

<p>The American War came to its only possible end with the grant of
American Independence. Great Britain turned to look to her own
domestic affairs, and found herself face to face with the possibility
of a second war. For Ireland, having once armed to resist Europe,
refused to disarm until she received her liberty. The Volunteers, in
other words, would not disperse except on the conditions that the
Irish Parliament should become a reality. Poynings' Law was to be
repealed. The right of legislative initiative was to be given back to
the Irish Parliament, and England was to admit solemnly and
categorically the right of Ireland to make laws for herself.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous demand, but the British Government had no choice
except to yield. Exhausted with the American struggle, the British
Ministers could not face a second war. The demands of Ireland were
granted, and thus in a moment Grattan's Parliament, in the full
panoply of armed strength, sprang into existence.</p>

<p>Well might Grattan exclaim, at the opening of that Parliament, in
words that still send a thrill through every true lover of freedom:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h3>HOME RULE IN HISTORY<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Grattan's Parliament was the first Parliament with full legislative
authority possessed by Ireland since the time of Henry VII. It existed
for nearly twenty years, and in that brief time it did a great work
for Ireland. If we look for its epitaph we shall find it, strangely
enough, in the words spoken in 1798 by the man who pursued Grattan's
Parliament with his venomous hate, and finally compassed its doom&mdash;the
famous Irish Chancellor, Lord Clare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2" style="padding-top: .25em; padding-bottom: .25em;"><p>"<b>There is not a nation on the face of the habitable globe
which has advanced in cultivation, in agriculture, in
manufactures, with the same rapidity, in the same period, as
Ireland.</b>"<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></div>

<p>But, great and splendid as was Grattan's victory, there were two
points of weakness in the settlement of 1782, soon to be revealed by
experience. One was that although the Irish Parliament obtained the
right of legislation, the appointment of the Government and the
Executive was still placed in the hands of the Irish Privy Council,
and therefore of the British Central Government. That meant, in the
end, that the British Government still possessed the leverage for
recovering the powers of legislative initiative and legislative veto.</p>

<p>As far as Ireland possessed separate executive powers, she used them
with loyalty and patriotism. Take, for instance, her finance. Ireland
possessed, under the settlement, a separate Irish Exchequer, and the
British Government could levy no war taxes in Ireland, except <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>with
the consent of the Irish Parliament. That gave to the Irish Parliament
an immense power of checking and hampering England in her struggle
against Napoleon. If we were to judge from some of the talk heard at
the present moment, one would take for granted that Ireland must have
refused all help to England in that struggle.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the Irish Parliament voted sums freely to Pitt for
the wars against France. The Irish statesmen would have no dealings
with the English Whigs in their pro-French policy. Like that other
great Irishman, Edmund Burke, Grattan was opposed to the spirit of the
French Revolution. In that great European crisis Ireland showed
herself what she really is&mdash;a nation inclined in all essentials to
conservative rather than revolutionary ideas.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>"CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION"</h4>

<p>But it was the existence of a separate external executive, gradually
limiting the legislative powers of the Irish Parliament, that finally
brought out the gravity of the other signal defect in the settlement
of 1782. That defect was the failure to effect a complete settlement
of the Catholic question. For the Irish Parliament, even after 1782,
was still confined to Protestants. Could any reasonable man call that
a final solution of the problem of government in a country where
four-fifths of the people were Catholics? With a truer foresight than
Grattan, Flood desired that the Volunteers should refuse to lay down
their arms until the Catholic question had been settled. But Grattan,
still filled with that spirit of generous trust which has been the
undoing of so many noble Irishmen, refused to use the military power
for any further exaction of terms. He disbanded the Volunteers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Grattan trusted that once the Irish Parliament was endowed with full
powers, the Catholic question would settle itself. He could rely with
certainty on his own Protestant followers. He persuaded them to repeal
the penal laws. He prevailed upon them to extend the franchise to the
Catholic peasant. Both those great reforms were passed through the
Irish Parliament in the fulness of its strength and power, and the
British Government were compelled to acquiesce. But there Grattan
reached the limit of his authority. There was one more great step
which had to be taken before the Catholic claims could be satisfied.
It was necessary to concede the right to a Catholic, as to a
Protestant, to sit in the Irish Parliament. When Grattan made that
proposal, he found himself faced with new forces. The British
Government and the Ascendancy Party in Ireland had already begun to
regain their hold over the Irish Parliament. The forces of patronage
and corruption were already at work.</p>

<p>If those had been the only powers Grattan might have defeated them.
Neither he nor his admirers were perhaps wholly aware of what we now
know to be the centre of this resistance&mdash;the dogged, almost insane,
obstinacy of George III. Pitt indeed had already lost his earlier
reforming zeal. The shadow of the French struggle had already fallen
across his path, and had already shaken his early faith in freedom and
progress. But if Pitt had been left alone he might still have done
justice. It was George III. that lost us the soul of Ireland, as he
lost us both the body and soul of North America.</p>

<p>There were, indeed, moments in those difficult days when the British
people seemed to realise dimly the wisdom of what Burke saw to be the
wisest British <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>fighting policy&mdash;the policy of rallying Catholic
Ireland against revolutionary France. There was, for instance, the
mission of Lord Fitzwilliam in 1795&mdash;a Whig mission extorted from Pitt
against his will, due to a Parliamentary complication, and backed from
London with but half-hearted support. That famous mission which sent
through Ireland such a strange, sad thrill of hope, soon closed in
mist and darkness. Lord Fitzwilliam went to Ireland, as many
Englishmen have gone since, with the intention of doing justice. He
was thwarted, like most others, by the resistance of the local
Ascendancy Party, fighting doggedly for the remnants of its power. It
was the place-holders of Ireland who, intriguing with the Ministry in
London, led to the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>For that party was then playing the same part as it is attempting to
play to-day. They were playing then, as ever since, on the nerves of
Protestant England. They were conjuring up the dread of Catholic
power, and the terror of Irish disloyalty. Unhappily, in the
confusions of the moment&mdash;the confusions of the French wars&mdash;they
succeeded. By compelling the recall of Lord Fitzwilliam they wrecked
the hopes of the Grattan Parliament.</p>

<p>For after 1795 that Parliament was practically doomed, and events
moved rapidly to their climax. Grattan, thwarted in his policy, and
unwilling to be responsible for a body over which he had no control,
withdrew into retirement. The Irish Catholics, feeling themselves
again betrayed and deserted, relapsed all over Ireland into sullen
indifference and detachment. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Protestant Parliament, deprived of
their leader, swung more and more towards the Ascendancy Party. Even
so, indeed, the virtue of self-government continued to work. No
Parliament has left a better record of good local work for the
prosperity of its country than Grattan's Parliament. From end to end
of Ireland new industries had sprung up, and new life had been put
into old industries. Ireland then was prosperous. Her exports had
doubled. Her wealth was increasing. Her towns overflowed with life,
and Dublin for the moment almost rivalled London in its brilliancy and
its wit.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE GREAT REBELLION</h4>

<p>This prosperity might have saved Grattan's Parliament but for a new
movement which had crossed the two channels from France. It is
doubtful whether the Catholics alone could have wrecked Grattan's
Parliament. It was, curiously enough, the Irish Presbyterians of
Ulster&mdash;our friends, the Orangemen&mdash;who sowed the seeds of revolt
against the Protestant Parliament of 1782. It was they, in the
combination known as the "United Irishmen," who started the movement
that culminated in the Irish Rebellion in 1798. These Presbyterian
Nonconformists had all been deeply affected by the doctrines of the
French Revolution. They had for years past been agitating for a reform
of the Irish Parliament on the lines subsequently adopted in
1831&mdash;chiefly by the abolition of the rotten boroughs. Grattan was
with them, but again <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>he was powerless. He was opposed, both in Dublin
and in London, by the existing executives. Those executives now rested
their power almost entirely on the members returned by those very same
rotten boroughs. For ever since 1782 bribery had been going on, and as
early as 1790 England had been rapidly buying back the hold she had
lost in 1782. These being her weapons, it was not likely that the
Irish executive was going to yield to the claims of the Irish
Presbyterians. The Government resisted, and the movement of the Irish
Reformers became more and more formidable.</p>

<p>All these causes of unrest culminated in the Irish Rebellion of
1798&mdash;a horrible event, beginning with the lawlessness of the
revolutionary Presbyterians in the north&mdash;lawlessness so feebly
checked as to raise grave suspicions in regard to the attitude of the
Irish Government itself towards a possible revolution. But the
outrages of the Orangemen on the Catholics in Ulster, and the Catholic
feeling of desertion by the Government, soon produced a far more
terrible outbreak in the south. That practically culminated in a
religious war between Catholic and Protestant. From that moment the
Rebellion was marked by atrocities on both sides almost as terrible as
anything which occurred in the French Revolution. The Rebellion was
extinguished in blood and fire.</p>

<p>The period of exhaustion and despair that followed in Ireland was
seized upon by Castlereagh and Pitt for destroying the Irish
Parliament. An immense machinery of bribery and corruption, assisted
by pledges that were broken and prophecies that failed, all working
under the double shadow of rebellion and war, drove the Irish
Parliament to reluctant suicide, and passed into law, both at Dublin
and Westminster, the Union Act of 1800.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>That great light of the Irish Parliament thus passed suddenly into
darkness. The Chamber which had resounded with the eloquence of Flood
and Grattan passed over to the money-changers, and ever since the
clink of coin has taken the place of the silver voices of the Irish
orators.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>AFTER THE UNION</h4>

<p>The events of 1800 left Ireland, for the moment, prostrate under the
heel of Great Britain. The last remnants of self-government
disappeared with the absorption of the two exchequers in 1817.
Although Ireland still retained a separate administration, that
administration was not under the control of any self-governing
authority. Out of the Dragon's teeth of the Union rose the sinister
army of a new bureaucracy, recruited almost entirely by the enemies of
Ireland, and for the most part even working with its guns trained
against the hopes and aspirations of the Irish race.</p>

<p>The artificial stimulus given to agriculture by the French wars
concealed for some years the greatness of the disaster. The population
of Ireland continued to rise. The Irish landlords, indeed, had for the
moment a strong motive to multiply their tenants, in the existence of
the forty shilling freehold vote granted by the Irish Parliament.
Holdings were sub-divided, and the cultivation of the potato
encouraged an even larger population on a lower level of subsistence.
This prepared the way for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the great catastrophe of the Irish famine
in 1847. It was that famine which brought out fully, for the first
time, the tremendous calamity inflicted on Ireland by the destruction
of her Parliament.</p>

<p>For it was not that England showed any lack of sympathy in dealing
with the Irish famine. It was indeed that event which finally
converted Sir Robert Peel to the abolition of the Corn Laws, and, more
even than the agitation of Richard Cobden or the speeches of John
Bright, contributed to the final triumph of Free Trade. It was not
want of sympathy that wrecked Ireland then. It was want of
understanding. For it was only an Irish Government, living on the
spot, and responsible to the people of Ireland itself, that could have
risen to the great height of that tremendous emergency.</p>

<p>The monstrous human disaster that followed&mdash;the loss of 2,000,000 of
population in twenty years&mdash;was the direct result of the destruction
of all the means of prompt salvage and repair which could have been
brought to bear only by a Home Rule Government.</p>

<p>During those calamitous decades another great evil emerged as a result
of the Union. Many bad things have been said against the Irish land
laws, and many of them are justified. But the Irish land laws in their
old working were simply rather an exaggerated form of the very same
laws that have survived in England right up to the present moment. Why
is it that these laws proved intolerable in Ireland, and have yet
survived up to the present moment in England? Simply because, after
the passing of the Act of Union, they were aggravated by the great and
terrible social evil of Absenteeism.</p>

<p>Even those bad laws could be made to work as long as there was a human
relationship between the landlords and their tenants. Up to 1830, at
any rate, there was a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>strong motive for that relationship. The
victory of Catholic emancipation was a colossal triumph for the genius
of Daniel O'Connell. It removed one of the worst surviving religious
injustices in this kingdom. But in Ireland it was a victory of the
tenant over the landlord, and it was achieved by a new alliance
between tenant and priest against the landlord. While giving
emancipation to the Catholics, the Act of 1830 also raised the level
of the franchise, and abolished the forty shilling freehold vote, thus
removing the landlord's motive for preserving the small tenancies.</p>

<p>The result was that the Irish landlords as a class&mdash;always, of course,
with many conspicuous individual exceptions&mdash;entered from 1830 onwards
upon a new career of hostility towards their tenants, amounting to
little less than a passion for revenge. Being, for the most part, both
Protestant and Absentee, they lost all interest in their tenantry,
except that of rent collectors. The Irish famine made matters far
worse. For the famine deprived the Irish tenant, for the moment, of
the power of paying rent. Not only so, but by reducing him to
pauperism it turned him into a distinct and definite burden on the
rates.</p>

<p>The Irish landlords then first conceived the idea that, by getting rid
of the people, they could save their pockets. At the same time, they
made the great discovery that beasts were more profitable than
peasants. Hence the great clearances and evictions of the period
between 1840-1870. Hence the cruel compulsory exodus of vast masses of
the people of Ireland to the shores of America. Hence, finally, the
bitter cleavage between landlords and tenantry which brought the whole
land system of Ireland crashing into ruin.</p>

<p>These disasters had one good effect. They roused <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>the Irish people
from their indifference. The bitter proofs of mis-government shown by
the breakdown of their land system brought home to every cottager the
need of a Home Rule Government. The great agitations for land reform
and Home Rule went on side by side&mdash;sometimes taking a form of
violence, but more and more of orderly constitutional pressure&mdash;until
in the seventies there emerged at Westminster a powerful Irish Party,
too strong either for the neglect or the indifference of any British
Government.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>ENGLAND'S NEED</h4>

<p>It was impossible, indeed, for Great Britain to be indifferent, for
she had suffered almost as much as Ireland. The hostility of the Irish
Party formed a perpetual source of danger to her Governments, both
Liberal and Tory, and a chronic source of instability in her
administration. The democratic movement in England was continually
weakened by the necessity of keeping Ireland down. That necessity
largely broke the strength of the great reform movement of the
thirties. It destroyed Sir Robert Peel's Government in the forties. It
broke down the strength of Mr. Gladstone's Government in the eighties.
Ireland and Irish affairs absorbed so much of the time of the British
Parliament that the affairs of Great Britain herself were neglected.
The old free and easy ways of the British Parliament were brought to a
summary close by the obstruction of the Irish Party in the eighties,
and the modern rules of compartment closure and strict limitation of
debate were forced upon the Mother of Parliaments.</p>

<p>It was these consequences, quite as much as the sufferings of Ireland,
that gradually converted a great body of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>the British people to the
cause of Home Rule. That process was going on throughout the seventies
and the eighties, and was brought to a climax by the conversion of Mr.
Gladstone in 1886. Since then the cause which was so despised in the
days of O'Connell has had one of the great English parties behind it,
and has so steadily made its way in the favour of the British nation
that it now stands on the threshold of accomplishment.</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>What, then, emerges from this survey? It is that in returning to Home
Rule as the mode of governing Ireland we are simply going back to the
old and traditional method of Irish rule. It is also that, on
surveying the past, we find not merely that Home Rule has often saved
Ireland, but that always the wider and the more generous the form of
Home Rule the more it has helped Ireland. The wiser course of
accepting Irish advice in Irish affairs has always turned the tide of
disaster, and brought the hope of a new happiness for Ireland. Surely
here we have a convincing proof that the logical consummation of this
policy by the restoration of Home Rule is the only means of bringing
back Ireland to a full and secure enjoyment of lasting well-being.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h3>HOME RULE IN THE WORLD<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>"Ah!" but I shall be told by Unionist critics who have followed me so
far, "but the tendency of the world at present is all towards great
empires and away from little states. You are reversing the process."</p>

<p>This will probably be one of the most frequent arguments that we shall
hear during the present discussions. We shall, perhaps, have thrown at
our heads cases like the absorption of Persia by Russia, of Tripoli by
Italy, of Morocco by France, and of the Congo by Germany.</p>

<p>If we are to argue the matter on those lines it will be fair to point
out, on the other side, that during the last decade Norway has
separated from Sweden, new provincial and state governments have been
created in Canada and the United States, new self-governing powers
have been given to Cuba and the Philippines by the Americans in
faithful and loyal adherence to their word at the time of the
Spanish-American war, and, even more recently, new powers have been
given to Alsace and Lorraine by the German Empire.</p>

<p>So the argument might go on, to and fro, each party pelting one
another with cases from other parts of the world. Perhaps at that
point it might be well to remember the grave and wise warning given us
by Lord Morley in his "Life of Gladstone"&mdash;that each case of political
re-adjustment really stands by itself, and that often little light can
be thrown, but rather darkness deepened, by studying too closely the
analogies from other communities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Still, though the case of the relations between England and Ireland
must always stand on its own merits, there are general tendencies in
the world which come under law. There are certain lessons to be
gathered from other countries which we should be unwise to ignore. The
Greeks, who were great constitution builders, amused themselves in
their later period by making immense collections of political
specimens from among the Hellenic States. Doubtless their politicians
derived some advantage from this practice of their philosophers.</p>

<p>There are general tendencies, and those tendencies may be classified
under the two familiar heads of (1) the tendency towards unity and (2)
the tendency towards division. These two tendencies are always going
on side by side in various parts of the world. But the puzzling part
of political study is that very often what seems a tendency towards
unity conceals a tendency towards division, and that what seems a
tendency towards division is really a tendency to unity.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE BRITISH EMPIRE</h4>

<p>Take, for instance, the famous case of the British Empire. Any
superficial observer from another clime or another planet might
conclude from reading the records, that the tendency within the
British Empire during the last century lay toward division. He would
find on looking the matter up in any book of reference that the
British Empire now includes nearly thirty Parliaments.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> He would
discover that the powers of the central authority have been gradually
waning until practically every great white community outside the
United Kingdom has now <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>complete control over its own local affairs.
He might even be excused some astonishment if he discovered also that
these communities placed heavy taxes on the imports of the mother
country, and were in no degree restrained from doing so, and that
there even existed a party in the home country who contended that that
act of filial attention ought to be rewarded by special preferences to
colonial imports at home. Perhaps he would be most astonished when he
discovered that these colonies were now engaged in raising their own
navies and armies, which might possibly in the future be used for
purposes independent of the central control.</p>

<p>Pursuing his enquiries, he would discover that this country of Great
Britain had conducted at great cost of life and money, less than ten
years ago, a war to prevent the separation and secession of one great
white community&mdash;that of South Africa&mdash;and that, having carried that
war to a successful conclusion, the central government had followed up
that war by granting to that great white community a strong central
local government, with complete control of its local affairs. "You
talk about the tendency to unity," he would say, "but have we not here
a clear instance of division?"</p>

<p>To all of which we should reply, and reply correctly&mdash;"Not at all! The
secret of our Empire is that we have found unity in difference. We
have achieved the miracle of combination by means of division of
power."</p>

<p>We should probably have some difficulty in persuading him of this
truth. He might be some Rip Van Winkle, who had gone to sleep during
the War of American Independence, and still derived from those days
his notions of the right principles of colonial government. But if he
conducted his enquiries further he would end by being fully persuaded.
For what would he discover? He <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>would find out that in spite of, or
perhaps by means of, this principle of division the British Empire was
now the most united Empire in the world. He would learn the amazing
story, incredible to almost any other nation, of the great rally of
colonial troops to the help of the Empire at the time of the Boer War.
He would read of the periodical Imperial Conferences at the Centre in
London. He would learn of the new drawing together now going on both
in regard to foreign policy and military strategy. He would contrast
all this with the spirit of the American Colonies between 1776 and
1782. He would look back, perhaps, to the beginning of this new era of
self-government, and recall the memory of Canada in rebellion, of
Australia in a state of permanent quarrel with Downing Street, and of
South Africa in perpetual, recurring, chronic confusion and disorder.
He would learn that before 1837 every white British colony was
discontented,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and that now every colony was loyal. He would
contrast these two pictures of Empire. Perhaps, then, he would realise
that the true secret of the strength of the modern British Empire lay
neither in militarism nor Imperialism, neither in swagger nor bounce
nor boasting nor pride, but in the gradual development of that amazing
policy of generosity and goodwill which is best typified in the
phrase, "Home Rule."</p>

<p>It is Home Rule that has saved the British Empire up to the present.
Is it not likely that it is Home Rule that will save her in the
future?</p>

<p>"Ah! but"&mdash;again will come the cry of the critic of the narrow
vision&mdash;"look at the South African Union. Is not that an instance of
unionism as against Home Rule? Have we not there in this latest
achievement a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>specimen of State authorities over-ruled by a central
power?"</p>

<p>In answer to that cry, I turn to the eighty-fifth clause of the South
African Act, 1909. In that clause I find the following powers reserved
for the local authorities of Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the
Orange River Colony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2">
<p class="noin">(1)  Direct taxation within their provinces.<br />
(2)  The right of borrowing money on their own credit.<br />
(3)  All education other than higher education.<br />
(4)  Agriculture.<br />
(5)  Hospitals.<br />
(6)  Municipal institutions.<br />
(7)  All local works and undertakings within their provinces.<br />
(8)  All roads and bridges within their provinces.<br />
(9)  Markets and towns.<br />
(10) Fish and game preservation.<br />
(11) The right of fine and imprisonment, and<br />
(12) Generally all matters which, in the opinion of the
  Governor-General in Council, are of a merely local or private
  nature.</p>
</div>

<p>Ireland would not very much mind that kind of unionism!</p>

<p>The fact is, of course, that this instance of South Africa is a
typical example of the principles of unity and division working at the
same time. In regard to South Africa as a whole, the Union Act was a
great and beneficent grant of Home Rule. It was the end of a long
period of harassing interferences with the affairs of South Africa on
the part of the Imperial Government at home, through its High
Commissioner on the spot. That process is even now unfinished. It will
probably in the end have to be brought to completion by the inclusion
within the authority of the South African Parliament of countries like
Rhodesia, and even, perhaps, of Basutoland.</p>

<p>But in regard to South Africa itself, the same Act was a case of true
unionism required and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>necessitated by the conditions of the country.
Before 1909 the South African states were suffering within themselves
from excessive division of functions. They were quarrelling over
railways and tariffs. They were unable to pursue any common policy or
common aim. That perpetual division of functions weakened them in the
presence of the world, and rendered them unfit for local guidance. We
should have a similar situation in this country if England, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales were all under separate governments, with separate
tariffs and separate policy. In that case the doctrine we should be
preaching to-day would not be Home Rule, but Unionism. For these two
tendencies throughout the world are like a see-saw. Both are required
for efficient government. Both may be carried to excessive and
exaggerated lengths. Our case in regard to the United Kingdom is that
unionism has been carried to excessive lengths, and requires to be
tempered by Home Rule.</p>

<p>For let any Unionist glance round the world outside the British
Empire. He will find that the British do not stand alone in their
trust in the Home Rule principle. Nearly every great Empire in the
world rests upon Home Rule as its basis. Even Russia, perhaps the most
centralised of all, has its provincial councils, known as the
Zemstvos, and it was one of M. Stolypin's most daring actions that he
even broke the letter of the Russian Constitution in order to
strengthen the Zemstvos of Eastern Russia. Finland, too, a province of
Russia, possesses a larger form of local government than is even being
demanded by Ireland. It is a curious irony of the present situation
that many of those Britons who refuse self-government to Ireland are
most diligent in watching the action of Russia in relation to the
powerful and&mdash;up to the present&mdash;almost independent Parliament of
Finland.</p>

<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><br />
<h4>THE GERMAN EMPIRE</h4>

<p>If we pass from Russia to the other great human combinations, we shall
find the principle of Home Rule far more extensively and powerfully
developed. Take China, a combination of 400,000,000 of human beings,
now changing before our eyes from an absolute monarchy to a
constitutional republic. But whether as a monarchy or a republic,
China has always rested her rule on gigantic and almost autonomous
provinces, under separate Viceroys. Those provinces have doubtless
been subject to the same autocratic control as China herself, but with
the change in her central government they will probably pass by an
easy transition into Home Rule provinces. Or come nearer home to an
Empire which most Englishmen imagine to be the most centralised in the
world&mdash;the German Empire. That Empire rests upon a basis of twenty-six
autonomous governments, varying from autocracies at one end to
republics at the other. The German Empire contains within it every
form and shape of human community, varying from sheer medi&aelig;valism to
extreme modernism. But whatever the form or shape of these separate
governments, they are all alike in having control over their own local
affairs. Most of the great states of Germany still possess control
even over their own railways. They have their own Parliaments, their
own judges, and, in many cases, their own reigning sovereigns. It was
part of the wisdom of the founders of the German Empire that they made
no attempt to interfere with these local powers. They contented
themselves with combining all those forces for common defence,
including them under a common tariff, and giving to them a common vote
for a common assembly at the centre. In other words, Germany rests
upon the two principles of unity and division, and in that combination
lies its strength.</p>

<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><br />
<h4>THE UNITED STATES</h4>

<p>Or turn to the United States. There you have another of those powerful
human governments resting on a basis of forty-six State authorities,
each with its own legislature, and even with its own little army. Each
of those state governments has control over such great matters as
criminal and civil law, marriage and divorce, licensing, education,
game laws, and the regulation of labour. They have the right to place
a direct tax upon property. They have their own governors and their
own ministries. And yet they all work harmoniously within the central
authority of the Federal States. Probably by no other means could that
great combination be held together.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>AUSTRIA-HUNGARY</h4>

<p>Or come back to Europe, and take the astonishing case of Austria and
Hungary. There you have two countries of different race and different
language, with different ideals, and with bitter memories of past
strife lying between them. A generation ago it was a commonplace among
all politicians that the Austrian Empire must break up. Yet it still
holds together, and has recently shown itself capable even of
aggressive action. The prophecy of decay is being pushed further and
further forward, and Austria still remains the great Christian bulwark
of Europe. How has that miracle been achieved after the terrible
internecine struggles of the mid-nineteenth century? How is it that
Hungary has forgotten the hangings and the butcheries of the sixties,
and still works within the Austrian Empire? Why, simply by virtue of
the principle of Home Rule.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Austria and Hungary, indeed, represent a far more extreme and daring
instance of this principle than it is necessary to put forward in
regard to Ireland. They possess distinct Parliaments and distinct
ministries. Those Parliaments sit apart and legislate apart and
neither possess any representation in the other. But they have, as we
have already seen, their link, not merely in a common Emperor and
King, but in a common body called the Delegations. There is the
Austrian Delegation and the Hungarian Delegation, both consisting of
sixty members, twenty from each Upper House, and forty from each Lower
House. The delegations sit alternately at Vienna and Buda Pesth, and
they deliberately and independently communicate their decisions by
writing. But if after three such interchanges no decision is arrived
at, then the whole 120 meet together and settle the matter by vote
without discussion. They possess a common Minister for Foreign
Affairs, a common Minister of War, and a common Minister of Finance.
Count Von Aehrenthal, who has in late years produced so startling an
effect on European politics, is the common Minister for Foreign
Affairs for Austria and Hungary, two countries with distinct
Parliaments.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>INDIA</h4>

<p>I return from this tour of the world back to the British Empire. Here,
too, the principle of Home Rule has been working, not merely in regard
to our white dominions, but during the last ten years even more
daringly in regard to the countries of our black subjects. The great
Indian Reform Act of 1909 has created in India what are practically
the first beginnings of Home Rule Councils. Seven great provinces of
India have now each of them <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Legislative Councils of their own, and on
nearly all of these Councils the unofficial members are in the
majority.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The powers of these Legislative Councils are still very limited; but
who can doubt that they will increase?</p>

<p>We are, in other words, faced with the fact that while Ireland has
been waiting for Home Rule we have taken the first great step in
granting Home Rule to India. Surely this is a fact that presents a new
challenge to the reactionary Unionist of the United Kingdom. Does he
really contend that Ireland is incapable of receiving the same
liberties as we are granting to India? Or will he make the wicked and
dangerous suggestion that we are only conceding these things to India
by force from fear of disorder, and in that way threaten the happy
peace of Ireland?</p>

<p>Surely the concession of Home Rule to India removes the last vestige
of an Imperial argument against Home Rule for Ireland also!</p>

<br />
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<br />

<p>Such are the results of a general survey at the present moment. They
show that in proposing Home Rule for Ireland we are not rowing against
the tide, but following the drift of a general law which is prevailing
all over the world.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h3>HOME RULE FINANCE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Home Rule finance is already the subject of a whole library of books
and pamphlets, and there is some danger that the money question may
occupy a place out of all perspective and proportion in the coming
controversy. Men quarrel over money very easily, and some of the
fiercest opponents of Home Rule still imagine that they can silence
the Home Rulers by talking "money" at the top of their voices. But the
Home Rulers must not be drawn into that net. They must refuse to view
this matter as a question merely of book-keeping and accounts. They
must remember always that the financial difficulty is simply another
statement of the fact of Irish poverty, and that Irish poverty is due
to the Act of Union. It is not any financial arrangement, but Home
Rule itself, that will cure the difficulties of Irish finance.</p>

<p>On the one side, the English are being told that they are going to be
bled white in order to please Ireland. On the other side, the Irish
are being warned by their extremists that England hopes to undo the
effects of Home Rule by a dowry of impoverishment. On both sides of
the Channel the enemies of Home Rule hope to use this as a weapon to
defeat the cause. Let us, therefore, keep our heads, and look at the
problem calmly and sanely.</p>

<p>What is the present position in regard to Irish finance? It has
totally changed since 1893. It follows, therefore, that the financial
proposals of the 1886 and the 1893 Bills are of little value to us as
a guide to the policy of 1912.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In those days the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>British
Government could cheerfully propose a fixed contribution of over
&pound;4,000,000 from the new Irish Parliament, as in the Bill of 1886, or
an allocation of one-third of the general revenue of Ireland, for
Imperial expenditure, as in the Bill of 1893. Lord Morley has told us
that in 1886 Mr. Parnell was gravely disturbed over the finance
proposals of Mr. Gladstone. We thought him unreasonable at the time,
and perhaps a little mean. I can remember Liberals saying hard things
about the Irish attitude in those days. But the events that have
occurred since prove that Mr. Parnell, on that occasion, was only
exercising his customary shrewdness. He saw to the root of the matter.
He was evidently possessed with the fear that he might be saddled with
a poverty-stricken Home Rule Parliament, and the course of events
since 1886 has somewhat justified his fear.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE NEW IRISH DEFICIT</h4>

<p>For since 1886, two events have happened. The first has been that
Ireland instead of being the creditor is now the debtor of England.
The most recent Treasury estimate, as given by Mr. Asquith in his
first reading speech on the Home Rule Bill of 1912 gives the true
deficit of Ireland for 1912-3 at &pound;1,500,000. I am aware that the
Treasury estimates are open to many criticisms, which have been
brilliantly stated by Professor Kettle in his handbook on "Home Rule
Finance,"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> but for our present purposes we are bound to accept
these figures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>What do they show? In the first place, they fully bear out the
forecast of the Financial Relations Commission that the position of
Ireland under the Act of Union would become steadily worse. We have
probably not yet reached the bottom of the hill. Ireland is so poor
that each new Act for the relief of poverty increases the
disproportion between the expenditure of Great Britain and Ireland.
There is no way out of that vicious circle. If England were to
increase Irish taxation she would simply increase the poverty which
she has to relieve. During the last fifty years, in fact, the British
Government has had to give back in some form of relief an equivalent
for almost every increase of taxation enforced upon Ireland. If
Ireland cannot pay, England must pay. That means that unless Home Rule
is given during the next twenty years Ireland will become an
increasingly heavy charge upon Great Britain.</p>

<p>In face of these facts, it is clear that Great Britain will be wise to
"cut the loss." Considerable scorn has been thrown on the suggestion
made by Professor Kettle and others that Great Britain should present
Ireland with a dowry of &pound;20,000,000 on the occasion of setting up a
Home Rule Parliament. Mr. Kettle called it a "wedding present," to
which Mr. F.E. Smith retaliated with some humour that it was really a
"separation allowance." Mr. Kettle has since replied with even better
humour that as Home Rule is the only true marriage between the nations
his description is the more correct. This is all a pretty play of wit,
but we must not allow it to conceal from us the fact that if John Bull
deals generously with Ireland at this present moment he will be
playing the part, not merely of a philanthropist, but of a good
business man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>There are many ways in which this generosity can be shown. A big
capital sum of money would probably be bad both for England and for
Ireland. It would give Ireland a sense of dependence, and it would
leave England with a sense of injury. There are many other better ways
of making this financial adjustment. The charge which has turned
Ireland into a debtor to England, for instance, is the &pound;2,500,000
drawn from the Imperial Exchequer for Irish Old-age Pensions. The men
and women who are receiving those pensions are the veterans of the
famine period, and England has a special obligation towards them.</p>

<p>The Home Rule Bill of 1912 provides that these old age pensions should
be kept for the moment as an Imperial charge. That will be both a
generous and humane provision.</p>

<p>Another proposal made by Irish financial reformers is that the Royal
Irish Constabulary, a force which costs &pound;1,370,000 a year, should be
regarded and paid for as an Imperial force. The argument is that the
Royal Irish Constabulary was created in the interests of the English
garrison&mdash;was, in fact, an army of occupation, which, since the new
settlement of the Irish land question, has become, in Mr. Kettle's
witty phrase, an "army of no occupation."</p>

<p>That proposal is not adopted in the Home Rule Bill of 1912. The force
is kept under the control of the British Government for six years, and
it will then be handed over to Ireland. In the meantime, it will be
paid for out of the money reserved from Irish revenue by the Imperial
Government. We shall have to wait, therefore, for six years before the
Irish Government is able to apply economy to what is perhaps the most
expensive and most extravagant service in the whole administration of
Ireland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>The general financial proposals of the 1912 Bill are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The British Treasury takes the Irish revenue and divides it into three
portions. The first is the postal revenue, which will be both
collected and controlled by the Irish Government, as the Post Office
will be handed over immediately. The second is the "transferred"
revenue, amounting to &pound;6,350,000, which is the estimated cost of the
services delegated to the Irish Parliament, such as the Civil Service,
the payment of judges, and so forth. This revenue will still be
collected by the Imperial Government, but handed over to Ireland. The
third portion will be the "reserved" revenue, consisting of the amount
retained by the British Treasury for the services over which it will
retain control. Those services will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The upshot is that the British deficit, which stands at present at
&pound;1,500,000, will rise to &pound;1,911,000. That will be covered by a grant
of &pound;500,000 a year. That grant <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>will be reduced annually by decrements
of &pound;50,000 until it reaches &pound;200,000.</p>

<p>There is no need for the British taxpayer to be alarmed at this
balance-sheet. The essential fact is that Home Rule will work steadily
on the side of thrift and saving. The substantial points are&mdash;(1) that
pensions will from this time forward steadily decrease; (2) that the
Royal Irish Constabulary will be diminished; and (3) that any increase
in the prosperity of Ireland will result in an increasing yield of
taxation collected by the British Treasury and devoted to the benefit
of the British taxpayer. The British taxpayer, in a word, is
thoroughly well looked after.</p>

<p>Doubtless these proposals will be subjected to much criticism in
committee, and no one would pretend that they could not be improved in
detail. It might be argued, for instance, that it would be better for
Great Britain to make herself responsible for the Royal Irish
Constabulary as an Imperial charge, and therefore have a motive for
reducing it. That action might be taken as a generous substitute for
the bonus of &pound;500,000 a year, which may possibly not produce
favourable effects on the relations between the two countries. As
against the extra charge to the British Treasury, you would have the
fact that the British Government could immediately proceed to reduce
the Constabulary.</p>

<p>But once give Ireland a chance by some such settlement as this, and
then the main problem of finance will solve itself. For we cannot
ignore one very important aspect of that problem&mdash;the extravagance of
Irish government. One of the most startling revelations of the
Financial Commission Report was that Ireland, a poor country, cost
twice as much to govern as Belgium, a country of nearly twice the
population. Mr. Kettle has <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>shown since that the Civil Service of
Ireland is four times as great, and costs more than four times as
much, as the Civil Service of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Why is this? Because at the present moment two systems of government
are existing in Ireland side by side&mdash;the old and the new. The old is
for the most part an encumbrance and an impediment, but the new is
required for doing the work of land purchase and agricultural
development. Ireland is like a household into which a new staff of
servants is being imported, while nobody dares to disturb the old.
Could there be a more extravagant way of governing a country?</p>

<p>The only way to put that house in order is to give it Home Rule. All
the rights of existing civil servants must be respected, and therefore
the saving on that account will only be gradual. Mr. Kettle estimates
it at &pound;700,000 within a reasonable time. That is probably even an
under-estimate. For once this kind of saving begins, it soon tells on
a nation's expenditure. Ireland is at present governed from the point
of view of the place-hunters. Once Ireland begins to be governed from
the point of view of the Irish people, then the reign of extravagance
will be at an end.</p>

<p>Once the Home Rule Parliament is set up we shall be able to
distinguish clearly between Ireland's local and her Imperial
obligations. We shall hear much indignant talk against any proposal
that Ireland shall pay less than her full proportional contribution
for Imperial Defence. Those who are so moved on this question seem to
forget that the British Colonies pay practically nothing. Yet we have
never heard that they are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>paupers on that account. They certainly
derive more from the Empire than Ireland. Therefore, there would be
nothing either degrading or unjust even if Ireland were relieved from
all Imperial expenditure for a term of years. For Ireland requires
time to recover from the impoverishment of the past, and it may be
wise to give her that time. But once that time is over, the Irish
Parliament will probably wish to follow in the steps of the Grattan
Parliament, and contribute her honest due to the Empire of which she
will be a part. But that due must be paid, not out of deficit, but out
of surplus. As long as Ireland has a deficit produced by poverty, it
is absurd to talk to her about Empire. Once she has a surplus&mdash;and a
surplus will soon come with the working of Home Rule&mdash;then she will
play her part in a manly way.</p>

<p>For we must never forget that Home Rule in itself is a great financial
asset. During the brief period of the Grattan Parliament, as we have
seen, Ireland doubled her exports. During that time the Parliament
carried out public works in every part of Ireland, and industry
throve. Those things cannot be done by an absentee Parliament. They
can only be done by a Parliament on the spot. They are intensely and
earnestly needed by Ireland at present. For Ireland is largely an
industrial derelict, waiting for the restoring hand of a central
governing power. It is impossible to put this aspect of the matter
into figures. Here we must move in faith. But we cannot see this
matter clearly unless we believe firmly&mdash;as we have every
justification for believing&mdash;that Home Rule means wealth to Ireland.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE FINANCIAL COMMISSION</h4>

<p>But we have to remember that since 1893 a great and authoritative
Financial Commission has reported that England stands in debt to
Ireland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>The British public has never quite realised what the Report of 1896
signified, or quite understood the effect which it produced on the
Irish nation. The Financial Relations Commission was a body created by
the Liberal Government in 1894, soon after the defeat of the Home Rule
Bill, and partly as a consequence of that defeat. It consisted of
fifteen of the ablest financiers in the United Kingdom, including two
great Treasury Chiefs, Lord Farrer and Lord Welby, Sir Robert
Hamilton, Sir David Barbour, and that great Parliamentary financial
expert Mr. W.A. Hunter. The chair was occupied by an ex-Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Mr. Childers.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The Commission sat for two years, and
carried out a most searching investigation. They reported in 1896.
Their united Report consists of only two pages in the Blue Book,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
and the essence of it is contained in five short paragraphs, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2" style="font-size: 90%;"><p>(1) That Great Britain and Ireland must, for the purpose of
this inquiry, be considered as separate entities.</p>

<p>(2) That the Act of Union imposed upon Ireland a burden which,
as events showed, she was unable to bear.</p>

<p>(3) That the increase of taxation laid upon Ireland between
1853 and 1860 was not justified by the then existing
circumstances.</p>

<p>(4) That identity of rates of taxation does not necessarily
involve equality of burden.</p>

<p>(5) That whilst the actual tax revenue of Ireland is about
one-eleventh of that of Great Britain, the relative taxable
capacity of Ireland is very much smaller, and is not estimated
by any of us as exceeding one-twentieth.</p></div>

<p>Now, what does this amount to? As worked out in the various minority
reports, it means that, in the opinion of this Commission, Ireland has
been over-taxed for many <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>years at the rate of over &pound;2,000,000 a year.
As to the precise sum the Commissioners differ. Some went as high as
&pound;3,500,000, others down to &pound;2,000,000, but all, except Sir Thomas
Sutherland and Sir David Barbour, set it at about &pound;2,000,000. Mr.
Childers, unhappily, died before the close of the Commission. But he
wrote an epoch-making Report, in which he estimated the excess of
taxation at &pound;2,250,000.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Now, it is useless to make light of this Report. It was the solemn
judgment of the highest financiers of the day on the financial
workings of the Act of Union. If we turn back to the debates in
Parliament in 1800, especially to the speeches of Pitt, prophesying
that the Act of Union would take the wealth of England across St.
George's Channel, and apply it to Ireland, we cannot escape some
sombre reflections on the short-sightedness of great statesmen. Pitt's
judgment was disturbed by the existence of a war with France, which
created in him an intense desire to unite the two countries. Otherwise
he would probably have foreseen that for a rich partner to unite his
finances with a poor partner certainly meant bankruptcy for the one,
and probably, in the end, also ruin for the other. Taking the
nineteenth century as a whole, the fundamental financial error has
been this&mdash;that Ireland has been taxed on the theory of equality with
England in point of wealth. That equality has not existed. What was a
light burden for the one country has proved for the other a burden too
heavy to be borne.</p>

<p>The result has been that Ireland, being continually overtaxed, has
sunk steadily in her resources, and has gradually become less and less
of a taxable country. The taxes have returned less and less, and have
had to be <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>returned in the form of relief of poverty. A crisis in that
situation is now reached, and it is quite clear that we stand at the
parting of two roads. Now that the balance is beginning to work
against England, it is certain that the only alternative to the
restoration of Ireland is the gradual dragging down of England.</p>

<p>It is useless and unjust to argue, in answer to this great Report,
that Ireland ought not to have been regarded as a financial unit at
all. Any country that is an island, and possesses a social
organisation of its own, with a definite relationship between rich and
poor, must necessarily be a financial unit. But even if that were not
so, it is too late to argue the question with any honour. For we must
never forget that the whole financial legislation of the United
Kingdom in regard to Ireland is based upon the Act of Union, which was
practically a solemn treaty between the two countries, passed&mdash;we will
not say how&mdash;by both the British and the Irish Parliaments. It is the
essence of that treaty that Ireland entered into it upon certain
financial terms, and among those terms was the condition that she
should be treated as a separate financial unit.</p>

<p>This Report, therefore, immensely strengthens the claim of Ireland to
more generous financial terms in 1912 than in 1886 or in 1893.</p>

<p>We want to set up in Ireland a high and strong sense of financial
responsibility. The control therefore, as well as the expenditure,
must be placed as far as possible in Irish hands, and for that purpose
the management, as well as the collection, of Irish taxes ought to be
left as far as possible with the Irish Exchequer that must be set up.</p>

<p>The tendency is started by the principle of the Bill of 1912, and the
policy of the next decade will be to place <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>in Irish hands as rapidly
as possible both the collection and the administration of the finance
for all the great Irish services, including those at present
"reserved" as well as those at present "transferred."</p>

<p>This brings us finally to the vexed problem of Customs and Excise. It
is notorious that the greater part of the Irish revenue&mdash;the revenue
of a poor country, derived for the most part through indirect
taxation&mdash;is drawn from Customs and Excise.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>It is not, perhaps, surprising, therefore, that the Bill of 1912
should go some way towards meeting the demand that has sprung up in
various quarters, both in Ireland and in England, for the control of
customs and excise by the Irish Parliament. The proposal of the
Government is that we should extend to Ireland, with some variations,
what is at present the financial arrangement in regard to customs and
excise between the British Treasury and the Isle of Man. The first
fact to be remembered quite clearly is that the Irish Parliament is
absolutely debarred from creating any new duty. It will not be able to
draw up any new set of tariffs. In other words, it will have to adapt
its revenue to the general financial policy of the central government,
whether that be a free trade policy or a tariff reform policy. But
Ireland is to be allowed to vary her customs within certain limits.
She may, for instance, reduce her customs to the lowest point, on the
only condition that she loses thereby equivalent revenue. But on the
main custom duties which fall on such articles as tea, sugar, cocoa,
tobacco, and so forth, she cannot raise her customs beyond 10 per
cent. The only exceptions will be beer and spirits, on which Ireland
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>may raise her customs or her excise to any point that she desires. It
will be necessary, of course, to have rebates or countervailing duties
in regard to articles transferred from Great Britain to Ireland, or
<i>vice versa</i>, and to that very slight extent alone will these
proposals affect the trade relations between Ireland and England.</p>

<p>I may add that the same power of reduction or addition will extend
both to income tax and death duties up to the limit of 10 per cent.
for increase&mdash;a provision which will safeguard the industries of the
North from being sacrificed to the needs of the South.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Such are the proposals of the 1912 Home Rule Bill. They appear to
present an ingenious compromise between the complete delegation of
customs and excise and the complete centralisation. There are very
serious objections to the complete separation of these duties. One is
that separation of customs has been accepted everywhere as vitally
inconsistent with the Federal idea. No State of the American Union has
separate customs. Even Bavaria, a State of the German Empire which
possesses, as we have seen, a separate army, post office, and national
railways, has no separate customs. Such a plan could, therefore,
hardly fit in with Federalism, as at present realised in any part of
the world. The second objection would be the very grave offence given
to the free trade sentiment of Great Britain, and the very grave
injury to trade between Britain and Ireland, if we were to hand over
to Ireland the right of placing taxes on English goods. Under such
circumstances it would certainly be impossible to persuade the British
public to grant a bonus to Ireland in order to give her the power of
taxing British goods. That would clearly be too great a strain upon
the Christian sentiment even of John Bull.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Parnell, it is well known, felt a strong temptation to make a demand
for separate customs. But he always put it aside as impolitic,
probably on this very ground; and the rise of the Tariff Reform
movement since his death has certainly not weakened those
considerations, because it has led to a corresponding rise of free
trade feeling among a large part of the British public on this side of
the Channel.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the Government's compromise on customs and
excise, ingenious as it is, will be subject to very close and shrewd
criticism. But the first duty of Home Rulers, both in Great Britain
and Ireland, is to avoid the carefully-baited trap of a quarrel on
points of detail. That is the obvious game of the enemies of Home
Rule. The proper policy of every true Home Ruler is to preserve
through all the vicissitudes of those financial discussions a sane and
steady perspective, well knowing that, after all, finance is not
really the true heart of this problem.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>THE MIGHTY HOPE</h4>

<p>We must not reduce a great human problem to a squabble over
pocket-money. We must in this, too, as in the religious and political
sides of the question, have faith in the result of freedom. We must
believe, as we have every right to believe, that liberty will bring to
Ireland a new power over her resources, and a new skill in using
them&mdash;that her magnificent harbours will no longer be silent, or her
rivers empty; that her factories will hum once more with a new life
and industry; that the grass will cease to grow in her streets and on
her wharves, and that the rich and strong will cease to fly from her
shores. All this must be taken into account in any reasonable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>calculation of the future. It is just as foolish to err from lack of
faith as it is to blunder from excess of credulity.</p>

<p>For here, indeed, we have an excellent precedent to give us hope. It
was the common evidence of all experts at the time that Ireland grew
greatly richer under the twenty years of Grattan's Parliament. The
future Irish Parliament will, just as it will be more representative,
so supply Ireland with a machine even more efficient than Grattan's
Parliament. If so, we have every reason to suppose that within twenty
years we shall have a richer Ireland, with a far greater taxable
capacity. For can we doubt that the alchemy of liberty will here, too,
even in this sordid realm of finance, repeat its ancient power?</p>

<h4>OUTLINE OF FINANCIAL PROVISIONS.</h4>

<p>It is estimated that the expenditure for Irish purposes in the year
1912-13 will amount to &pound;12,354,000. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>expenditure may be divided

<p>The expenditure therefore exceeds the revenue by &pound;1,515,000.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that in a period of ten or fifteen years the charges
under the existing Land Purchase Acts will increase by &pound;450,000, and
under the National Insurance Act by &pound;300,000. On the other hand, it is
estimated that within twenty years the cost of Old Age Pensions will
decrease by &pound;200,000.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Charges upon the Irish Exchequer.</i></p>

<p>The Bill provides for the establishment of an Irish Exchequer and an
Irish Consolidated Fund.</p>

<p>From the Irish Exchequer will be defrayed the whole of the present and
future cost of Irish government, with the exception of the expenditure
on certain services, termed in the Bill Reserved Services.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Charges upon the Imperial Exchequer.</i></p>

<p>The Imperial Government will retain the control, and the Imperial
Exchequer will continue to bear the cost, of the Reserved Services,
namely, Old Age Pensions, National Insurance, Labour Exchanges, Land
Purchase, and Collection of Taxes. For a period of six years the Royal
Irish Constabulary will also be one of the Reserved Services.</p>

<p>There are provisions for the transfer to the Irish Government of
certain of the Reserved Services under the conditions stated below.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span><i>Revenue of the Irish Exchequer.</i></p>

<p>The Bill provides, in the first instance, for the period during which
the yield of Irish taxes is less than the cost of Irish
administration, and contemplates certain modifications after a
financial equilibrium has been attained.</p>

<p>During that period the revenue of the Irish Exchequer will consist of
a sum transferred annually from the Imperial Exchequer, and termed in
the Bill the Transferred Sum, together with the receipts of the Irish
Post Office.</p>

<p>The Transferred Sum will be fixed at the outset at such amount as will
cover, with the addition of the Post Office revenue, the present
expenditure on Irish Government, with the exception of the cost of the
Reserved Services. Included in the Transferred Sum will also be a
specified sum as surplus. The amount of this surplus will be &pound;500,000
annually for a period of three years, then diminishing by &pound;50,000 a
year for six years till it reaches &pound;200,000, at which sum it will
remain.</p>

<p>Subject to this variation in the amount of the surplus and to certain
minor variations specified in the Bill, and subject also to any
changes consequent upon the exercise by the Irish Parliament of the
powers of increasing or reducing taxation which are defined below, the
amount of the Transferred Sum, fixed in the first year after the
passing of the Act, will remain the same until an equilibrium is
reached between the total revenue derived from Ireland and the total
expenditure on Irish purposes.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Revenue of the Imperial Exchequer from Ireland.</i></p>

<p>The Bill provides that until such equilibrium is established the whole
of the proceeds of all Irish taxes shall be collected by the Treasury
of the United Kingdom, and be paid into the Imperial Exchequer. (This
provision does not apply to Post Office revenue.)</p>

<p>The revenue so collected should be sufficient to cover the Transferred
Sum and to provide a balance sufficient to defray a part of the cost
of the Reserved Services. As the revenue from Ireland increases in the
future, the receipts of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>Imperial Exchequer will increase
proportionately, and the yearly deficit which will fall at the outset
upon the Imperial Exchequer will gradually be lessened and ultimately
disappear.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Joint Exchequer Board.</i></p>

<p>The Bill establishes a Joint Exchequer Board of Great Britain and
Ireland, consisting of two members appointed by the Imperial Treasury
and two by the Irish Treasury, with a Chairman appointed by His
Majesty the King.</p>

<p>The duty of the Board will be to determine certain questions of fact
arising from time to time under the financial provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>The figures given in this Paper are estimates only, and do not purport
to be final. The Bill, therefore, does not rest upon these figures,
but enables fuller returns to be obtained after the passing of the
Act, and it provides that the amounts of Irish Revenue and Expenditure
for the purposes of the Act shall be, not the figures given in this
Paper, but such sums as may be determined after the passing of the
Act, upon the basis of these fuller returns and of the more accurate
figures of Revenue and Expenditure which will then be available, by
the Joint Exchequer Board.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Revenue and Expenditure Accounts.</i></p>

<p>If, however, the estimates given above are assumed, for purposes of
illustration, to be the figures finally determined, the Irish
Government's Budget in the first year would balance as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cen"><i>Powers of Varying Taxation.</i></p>

<p>The Bill confers on the Irish Parliament the following financial
powers:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. It may add to the rates of Excise Duties, Customs Duties on beer
and spirits, Stamp Duties (with certain exceptions), Land Taxes, or
Miscellaneous Taxes, imposed by the Imperial Parliament.</p>

<p>2. It may add to an extent not exceeding 10 per cent, to the Income
Tax, Death Duties, or Customs Duties other than the duties on beer and
spirits, imposed by the Imperial Parliament.</p>

<p>3. It may levy any new taxes, other than new Customs Duties.</p>

<p>4. It may reduce any tax levied in Ireland, with the exception of
certain Stamp Duties.</p>

<p>The Imperial Treasury will collect the revenue arising from any
increases in taxation enacted by the Irish Parliament in the exercise
of these powers; and an addition will be made to the Transferred Sum
of such amount as the Joint Exchequer Board may determine to be the
produce of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>additional taxation. Similarly, if taxation, is
reduced by the Irish Parliament, a deduction will be made from the
Transferred Sum corresponding to the loss of revenue due to the repeal
of a tax or to collection at the lower rates.</p>

<p>The Irish Exchequer will therefore gain or lose by any increase or
decrease in taxation enacted by the Irish Parliament, and the net
revenue of the Imperial Exchequer will remain unaffected by such
changes.</p>

<p>If Excise or Customs Duties are imposed at different rates in Great
Britain and Ireland respectively, provision is made for the adjustment
of the taxes paid in respect of articles passing from one country to
the other.</p>

<p>As administrative difficulties might arise in certain cases if the 10
per cent. limitation mentioned above were in terms to prohibit
additions to the taxes in question to an extent of more than 10 per
cent. of the rates of tax, the Bill effects the object in view by
enacting that only such proceeds of the tax as do not exceed 10 per
cent. of the yield of the Imperial tax shall be transferred to the
Irish Exchequer.</p>

<p>The Bill makes no specific reference to the powers of the Imperial
Parliament to levy taxation in Ireland. The provision in clause 1 that
the supreme power and authority of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom shall remain unaffected retains the existing powers of the
Imperial Parliament in this regard.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Transfer of the Reserved Services to the Irish Government.</i></p>

<p>After six years, the control of the Royal Irish Constabulary will pass
to the Irish Executive. The Irish Parliament is empowered to assume at
any time, with twelve months' notice, legislative and executive
control with respect to Old Age Pensions, to National Health
Insurance, or to Unemployment Insurance, together with Labour
Exchanges. When any such transfer of Reserved Services is effected,
the financial burden will be assumed by the Irish Exchequer, and an
addition will be made to the Transferred Sum corresponding to the
financial relief given to the Imperial Exchequer.</p>


<br />
<p class="cen"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span><i>Loans and Capital Liabilities.</i></p>

<p>Loans made for the purposes of land purchase and loans made before the
passing of the Act for other Irish purposes will be among the Reserved
Services, and the payment of interest and sinking fund charges will be
made by the Imperial Exchequer.</p>

<p>New loans may be raised by the Irish Parliament on the security of the
Irish revenue. Provision is also made for enabling the joint Exchequer
Board, if so authorised by the Irish Parliament, to issue the loans
and to meet the interest and sinking fund charges by means of
deductions from the Transferred Sum.</p>

<p>The Bill provides for the apportionment between the two Exchequers of
liability for existing loans raised for Irish services.</p>

<br />
<p class="cen"><i>Readjustment when Financial Equilibrium is reached.</i></p>

<p>When the total revenue received from Ireland by the Imperial Treasury
has been sufficient, during three consecutive years, to meet the total
charges for Irish purposes, the Exchequer Board shall report the fact
with a view to a revision of the financial arrangements. Since it is
impossible now to foresee what services may remain at that time as
Reserved Services, what loans may have been contracted during the
intervening years, and what changes may have been made in the rates of
taxation, the Bill does not attempt to enact the modifications which
may then be desirable.</p>

<p>It contemplates, however, as part of the present financial settlement,
that Parliament will then consider, on the one hand, the fixing of
such contribution by Ireland to the common expenses of the United
Kingdom as may be equitable, and, on the other hand, the transfer to
the Irish Legislature and Government of the control and collection of
such taxes as may be deemed advisable.</p>

<p>The remaining clauses&mdash;from 27 to 47&mdash;are concerned with readjustments
as to judges, civil servants, police and other matters, and do not
vary substantially from the corresponding clauses in the Bill of 1893
(published in <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D</a>). <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>The first meeting of the Irish Parliament
is fixed for the first Tuesday in September, 1913.</p>

<p>There are only two other clauses which require special notice, as
adding fresh provisions to those laid down in the Bill of 1893.</p>

<p>The first is the 26th clause, which gives to the Irish special powers
of representation at Westminster in the case of a revision of the
financial arrangements:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the purpose of revising the financial provisions of this Act in
pursuance of this section, there shall be summoned to the Commons
House of Parliament of the United Kingdom such number of members of
the Irish House of Commons as will make the representation of Ireland
in the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom equivalent to
the representation of Great Britain on the basis of population; and
the members of the Irish House of Commons so summoned shall be deemed
to be members of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom
for the purpose of any such revision."</p>

<p>The second&mdash;Clause 42&mdash;provides that Irish laws shall be interpreted
always in legal subordination to Acts of the Imperial Parliament:&mdash;</p>

<p>"(2) Where any Act of the Irish Parliament deals with any matter with
respect to which the Irish Parliament have power to make laws which is
dealt with by any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed
after the passing of this Act and extending to Ireland, the Act of the
Irish Parliament shall be read subject to the Act of the Parliament of
the United Kingdom, and so far as it is repugnant to that Act, but no
further, shall be void."</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;This Table is compiled from the Preliminary Reports of the
Census of 1911, which give the population returns only as far back as
1841. There was, of course, a Census of the United Kingdom as early as
1801, but the official returns extended at first only to England and
Scotland, and it was not until 1813 that there was any official census
of Ireland. Even then it was far from correct. The first trustworthy
Irish Census was that of 1821. For 1821 and 1831 the Census figures
are given in "Whitaker" as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="40%" summary="Census figures">
  <tr>
  <td width="70%" class="tdl">1821</td>
  <td width="30%" class="tdl">6,801,827</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td class="tdl">1831</td>
  <td class="tdl">7,767,401</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

<p class="noin">It is probable that the apparent rise of the population from 1821 to
1841 amounts to little more than the more correct taking of the Census
among an illiterate population. But on the whole subject of the rise
of population between 1821 and 1841, see my remarks in Chapter VIII.
p. 105. It was due of course very largely to the creation of faggot
votes by Protestant landlords desirous of being returned to Parliament
under the old law before the passing of Catholic Emancipation in 1829.
It was an artificial rise in the poorest section of the population
going along with a steady decline in the general material prosperity
of Ireland. Hence the great collapse of the famine period.</p>

resignation, the vacancy shall be filled by the election
to that office by the Irish peers of one of their number
in manner heretofore in use respecting the election of
Irish representative peers, subject to adaptation as
provided by this Act, and if the vacancy is not so filled
within the proper time it shall be filled by the election

<p>11.&mdash;(1.) Subject as in this section hereafter mentioned, the second

<p>(2.) The members of the second order shall be chosen by the existing
constituencies of Ireland, two by each constituency, with the
exception of the city of Cork, which shall be divided into two
divisions in manner set forth in the Third Schedule to this Act, and
two members shall be chosen by each of such divisions.</p>

<p>(3.) Any person who, on the appointed day, is a member representing an
existing Irish constituency in the House of Commons shall, on giving
his written assent to the Lord Lieutenant, become a member of the
second order of the Irish Legislative Body as if he had been elected
by the constituency which he was representing in the House of Commons.
Each of the members for the city of Cork, on the said day, may elect
for which of the divisions of that city he wishes to be deemed to have
been elected.</p>

<p>(4.) If any member does not give such written assent within <i>one
month</i> after the appointed day, his place shall be filled by election
in the same manner and at the same time as if he had assented and
vacated his office by death.</p>

<p>(5.) If the same person is elected to both orders, he shall, within
<i>seven days</i> after the meeting of the Legislative Body, or if the Body
is sitting at the time of the election, within <i>seven days</i> after the
election, elect in which order he will serve, and his membership of
the other order shall be void and be filled by a fresh election.</p>

<p>(6.) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, it shall be lawful for the

<h3>THE REDUCTION IN IRISH PAUPERISM OWING TO OLD AGE PENSIONS<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>The Report of the Irish Local Government Board for 1911 shows a
reduction in Irish pauperism between March, 1910, and March 26th,
1911, amounting to over 18,000:&mdash;</p>

<p>An analysis of the figures shows that the reduction is almost entirely
due to the Old-age Pensions Act. There is little or no reduction in
children, lunatics, or mothers, while there are the following
reductions in aged and infirm paupers:&mdash;</p>

<h3>APPENDIX G</h3>

<h3>THE LAND LAW (IRELAND) ACT, 1881<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>The provisions which have revolutionised the land system of Ireland
are contained in Clause 8 of the Land Act of 1881, which runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>8.&mdash;(1.) The tenant of any present tenancy to which this Act applies,
or such tenant and the landlord jointly, or the landlord, after having
demanded from such tenant an increase of rent which the tenant has
declined to accept, or after the parties have otherwise failed to come
to an agreement, may from time to time during the continuance of such
tenancy apply to the court to fix the fair rent to be paid by such
tenant to the landlord for the holding, and thereupon the court, after
hearing the parties, and having regard to the interest of the landlord
and tenant respectively, and considering all the circumstances of the
case, holding, and district, may determine what is such fair rent.</p>

<p>(2.) The rent fixed by the court (in this Act referred to as the
judicial rent) shall be deemed to be the rent payable by the tenant as
from the period commencing at the rent day next succeeding the
decision of the court.</p>

<p>(3.) Where the judicial rent of any present tenancy has been fixed by
the court, then, until the expiration of a term of fifteen years from
the rent day next succeeding the day on which the determination of the
court has been given (in this Act referred to as a statutory term),
such present tenancy shall (if it so long continue to subsist) be
deemed to be a tenancy subject to statutory conditions, and having the
same incidents as a tenancy subject to statutory conditions consequent
on an increase of rent by a landlord.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX H</h3>

<h3>THE IRISH CONGESTED DISTRICTS BOARD<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>The present Congested Districts Board, so often referred to in the
text, is constituted under the following clauses of the Irish Land Act
of 1909:&mdash;</p>

<p>45.&mdash;(1.) From and after the appointed day, the Congested Districts
Board shall consist of the following members:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2"><p class="hang">(<i>a.</i>) The Chief Secretary, the Under Secretary to the Lord
Lieutenant, and the Vice-President of the Department of
Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, who
shall be ex officio members:</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>b.</i>) Nine members appointed by His Majesty (in this Act
referred to as appointed members):</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>c.</i>) Two paid members appointed by His Majesty (in this Act
referred to as permanent members).</p></div>

<p>(2.) An appointed member shall hold office for five years, and shall
be eligible for re-appointment. On a casual vacancy occurring by
reason of the death, resignation, or incapacity of an appointed member
or otherwise, the person appointed by His Majesty to fill the vacancy
shall continue in office until the member in whose place he was
appointed would have retired, and shall then retire.</p>

<p>46.&mdash;(1.) For the purposes of the Congested Districts Board (Ireland)
Acts, as amended by this Act, each of the following administrative
counties, that is to say, the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim,
Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, and Kerry, shall be a congested districts
county, the six rural districts of Ballyvaghan, Ennistymon, Kilrush,
Scariff, Tulla, and Killadysert, in the county of Clare, shall
together form one congested districts county, and the four rural
districts of Bantry, Castletown, Schull, and Skibbereen, in the county
of Cork, shall together form one congested districts county.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>(2.) No electoral division shall, after the passing of this Act, be or
form part of a congested districts county, unless it is included in a
congested districts county constituted under this section.</p>

<p>The Act follows closely on the lines of the Report of the 1908
Commission, and places a third of Ireland under the Board.</p>
